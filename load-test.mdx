title: 'Load Testing Blnk with k6'
---

Load testing is a critical step in ensuring your Blnk deployment can handle expected traffic and maintain performance under various conditions. Blnk uses k6, a modern load testing tool, to facilitate this process. This guide will walk you through setting up and running a load test on your Blnk server using k6, with insights from a sample test result to help you understand and interpret your data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Cloned the Blnk repository to your local machine (if not done during server setup).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed (for running the Blnk server).
- k6 installed on your machine. Visit [k6.io](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation) for installation instructions.

## Setting Up Your Load Test

### Step 1: Clone the Blnk Repository

If the Blnk repository isn't already cloned:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerry-enebeli/Blnk && cd Blnk
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Load Test Directory

Switch to the load test folder within the Blnk repository:

```bash
cd tests/loadtest
```

### Step 3: Review the Load Test Script

The `script.js` file in the load test directory outlines the test:

- It sends HTTP POST requests to the `/transactions` endpoint of the Blnk server.
- Each request simulates a transaction with a unique reference ID, generated using the `uuidv4` function.
- The script is set to run with 5 virtual users (VUs) for 30 seconds.

#### Load Test Script (`script.js`)

```javascript
import http from "k6/http";
import { uuidv4 } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.4.0/index.js';
import { check, sleep } from "k6";

export const options = {
    vus: 5,
    duration: '30s',
};

export default function () {
    const url = 'http://localhost:5001/transactions';
    const payload = JSON.stringify({
        "amount": 100,
        "allow_over_draft": true,
        "reference": uuidv4(),
        "currency": "NGN",
        "source": "@cash",
        "destination": "@interests"
    });

    const params = {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
    };

    let response = http.post(url, payload, params);
    check(response, {
        'is status 201': r => r.status === 201,
    });
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Load Test
Within the `tests/load` directory:

```bash
k6 run script.js
```
