Grouping is crucial for complex reconciliation strategies, particularly for One-to-Many and Many-to-One reconciliations. Proper grouping ensures that transactions are matched accurately and efficiently. Grouping criteria define how transactions should be categorized before they are reconciled.

```json
{
  "grouping_criteria": {
    "parent_transaction": null,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "APPLIED",
    "description": "installment"
  }
}
```

| Fields | Description | 
| :--- | :--- |
| `parent_transaction` | This groups the transactions by their respective parent_transaction ids. Set to `null` if there's no specific parent ids to be grouped by. |
| `currency` | Ensures that all the transaction are in USD. |
| `status` | Only considers transactions that have been applied. |
| `description` | Adds another layer of filtering by checking for specific terms in the transaction descriptions. |

This grouping criteria can be used to ensure that only relevant transactions are considered for reconciliation, particularly in scenarios involving one-to-many reconciliation strategies.
