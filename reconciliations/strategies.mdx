## Overview

Reconciliation strategies define the relationship between external and internal transactions.

For example, a single internal transaction may correspond to multiple external transactions, or vice versa. With reconciliation strategies, you can specify how you want run your reconciliation.

Blnk support three types of strategies:

1. **One-to-One:** Ideal for straightforward payments where each external transaction has a single internal match.

2. **One-to-Many:** Suited for split transactions, such as a loan repayment split across multiple internal disbursements.

3. **Many-to-One:** Perfect for aggregating transactions, like daily sales combined into one internal ledger entry.

## One-to-One (1:1) strategy

This matches a single external transaction directly to a single internal transaction based on your [matching rules](/reconciliations/matching-rules).

```json
{
  ...
  "strategy": "one_to_one"
}
```

<Tip>
  `grouping_criteria` is not needed for one-to-one.

## One-to-Many (1:N) strategy

This matches a single external transaction with multiple internal transactions.

```json
{
  ...
  "strategy": "one_to_many",
  "grouping_criteria": "parent_transaction"
}
```

<Warning>
  `grouping_criteria` is required to combine related internal transactions before matching.
</Warning>

### How it works

1. **Group related internal transactions:**

    * Internal transactions are grouped with a grouping criteria, e.g., `parent_transaction` or a similar identifier.

2. **Summing transaction amounts:** The total sum of transaction amounts is calculated.

3. **Matching against the external transaction:**

    * The grouped internal transactions are compared to the external transaction using predefined rules:

        * **Date:** The earliest transaction date in the group is used for matching.

        * **Amount:** If the summed amount falls within the allowable drift, the match is confirmed.

        * **Reference/Description:** If at least one internal transaction matches, the group is valid.

        * **Currency:** One mismatched currency invalidates the entire group.

## Many-to-One (N:1) strategy

This is the inverse of the One-to-Many strategy. It matches multiple external transactions to a single internal transaction:

* The process mirrors the One-to-Many approach, but the roles are flipped.

* The amounts of multiple external transactions are summed and compared to the amount of one internal transaction.

* Matching rules (date, amount, reference/description, currency) are applied similarly as well.

```json
{
  ...
  "strategy": "many_to_one",
  "grouping_criteria": "description"
}
```

<Warning>
  `grouping_criteria` is required to combine related external transactions before matching.
</Warning>

## Choosing the right grouping criteria

Grouping criteria define how transactions are clustered before matching, ensuring that reconciliation strategies like One-to-Many and Many-to-One work correctly. 

Choosing the right grouping criteria prevents incorrect matches and improves reconciliation accuracy.

1. **One-to-Many:** You can group similar transactions by `parent_transaction`, `description` or `reference`.

2. **Many-to-One:** You can group by `description`.

```json Example
{
  ...
  "grouping_criteria": "parent_transaction"
}
```

### How it works

1. Before applying matching rules, transactions are grouped using a shared attribute.
2. Grouping ensures that unrelated transactions are not mistakenly matched.
