Reconciliation strategies allow you to outline how transactions are distributed between both records. Sometimes, one transaction in the internal record can be split into 2 or more transactions in the external record and vice versa.

These strategies help maintain the integrity of financial data by aligning transactions with corresponding payments, thus preventing discrepancies and ensuring that financial statements are accurate and reliable. 

In this guide, we will explore three common reconciliation strategies: [One-to-One](#1-one-to-one), [One-to-Many](#2-one-to-money), and [Many-to-One](#3-many-to-one). Each strategy serves specific purposes and suits different financial workflows.

## 1. One-to-one

The One-to-One reconciliation strategy involves a direct match between an internal transaction record and an external transaction record. It is the simplest form of reconciliation, ensuring that the amount in one system matches exactly with the corresponding amount in another system.

## 2. One-to-many

The One-to-Many reconciliation strategy is used when one external transaction record represents multiple internal transaction records. This strategy is useful for batch payments or situations where a single transaction needs to be matched with several smaller internal transaction records.

This strategy is commonly used to reconcile transactions that settle in groups, e.g., a credit of \$100 in your bank statement, may be recorded as \$90 to the customer, and \$10 for fees in your internal records.

For this to work:

- The matching internal transaction records must be equal to the external transaction record.
- You also need to specify how the internal transaction records must be grouped.

## 3. Many-to-one

The Many-to-One reconciliation strategy is employed when multiple external transaction records make up one internal transaction records. It is effective for cases such as installment payments, where several smaller transactions in your internal records over time need to be reconciled with a single larger external transaction record.

This strategy is commonly used to reconcile transactions that settle in groups, e.g., a bank transfer of \$100 may settle as \$10 and \$90 in your external records.
