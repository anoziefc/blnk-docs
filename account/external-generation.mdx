### External Account Generation
Blnk supports automated account number generation through external sources. This feature allows Blnk to fetch new account numbers from a specified RESTful service whenever a new account is created.

#### Configuration for External Account Generation
To enable external account number generation, include the following configuration in your `blnk.config` file:

```json blnk.config
{
"account_number_generation": {
    "http_service": {
        "url": "https://example.com/generate_account_number",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": "Bearer some_auth_token"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Expected Response Format
The response from the external account generation service should follow this format:

```json response from external service
{
    "account_number": "<generated_account_number>",
    "bank_name": "<associated_bank_name>"
}
```
