Blnk allows you to securely upload and link documents to an identity, making it easy to manage and verify customer information in your Ledger. This feature supports a range of document types (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.png`) and is useful for applications that require identity verification or compliance documentation.

For example, your application may need individuals to upload a selfie, identification documents (such as a National ID Card, Driver’s License, or Passport), or proof of address. Organizations might be required to upload incorporation documents, tax certifications, or any other official paperwork needed for verification and compliance purposes.

## Link a document to an identity

To link a document to an identity, it has to first be uploaded to Vault.

<Info>**Vault** is currently a Blnk Cloud feature. To get access, see the following: [Sign up to Blnk Cloud](https://blnkfinance.com/contact)</Info>

Next, pass the `vault_id` of the document in your `metadata` when creating your identity.
