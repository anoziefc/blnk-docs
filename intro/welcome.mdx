### Overview

Welcome to Blnk — an open-source ledger designed for the modern developer. It enables fintech developers to build and manage complex financial transaction records and money movement.

All fintech is made up of different transactions happening concurrently moving from one location to another. Some transactions will interact with external parties like cards, payouts, deposits, etc. Others will interact within your organization like moving money between user accounts or to/fro your organization accounts. 

Blnk gives you, the developer, a starting point to improve how you build, operate and perfectly manage money movement and storage in a reliable, scaleable and secure way.
