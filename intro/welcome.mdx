## Introduction

Blnk Ledger is an open-source fintech ledger database for building fintech products to standard and at scale. We designed Blnk to help developers do three things well:

- Accurately record transactions in their system.
- Correctly manage complex flow of funds and transaction data.
- Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

With Blnk, you get a full-service starting point for building, managing and operating money movement and store of value in a reliable, secure and scaleable way.
