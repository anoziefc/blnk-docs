### Overview

Welcome to Blnk — an open-source ledger designed for the modern developer. It enables developers to build and manage complex financial transaction records and money movement.

Every financial application is made up of different transactions happening concurrently moving from one location to another. Some transactions will interact with external parties like cards, payouts, deposits, etc. Others will interact within your application like moving money between user accounts or to/fro your organization accounts. 

Blnk gives you, the developer, a starting point to improve how you build, operate and perfectly manage money movement and storage in a reliable, scaleable and secure way.

### Who is Blnk for?

This documentation is intended for developers, software engineers and technical product managers who are building and operating any kind of financial application or software.

### Features overview

Here's a closer look at what Blnk provides you:

1. **Ledger management:** Create and manage detailed ledgers best suited to your use case to provide a clear and accurate record of balances and financial transactions in your application. This enables you to easily maintain your financial records in alignment with fundamental accounting principles.

2. **Internal ledger management:** Set up your organization's chart of accounts separate from other accounts, and easily track all transactions moving in and out of the accounts directly owned by your organization. 
   
   A chart of accounts is a list of financial balances grouped into categories such as revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc and used for recording transactions that the organization is directly involved in. 

3. **Balances and overdrafts:** Create and manage balances in one or multiple assets depending on your use case. Blnk also supports overdraft configurations giving you the flexibility to manage flow of funds more effectively.
