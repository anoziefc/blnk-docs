Hello! I’m Jerry, the creator of Blnk. Over the course of my career, I've dedicated myself to the financial services sector, a field I deeply cherish and plan to continue contributing to. 

The journey of building financial services and products is intriguing. It may start off straightforward, but the complexity unfolds as you dive deeper. These intricacies and challenges are things one typically learns through firsthand experience.

About two years ago, I embarked on a project driven by a vision to encapsulate my knowledge and experiences in a tool that would not only facilitate my own development of financial products but also assist others in this endeavor. That project was Blnk. The goal was to create an open-source ledger that stands as a testament to the collective wisdom in financial product development, encouraging a culture of shared learning and improvement.

Choosing to make Blnk open source was a strategic decision aimed at fostering a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about innovating and refining financial services. This openness is not just about offering a tool for better product development; it's about inviting contributions that enhance our collective understanding and capabilities in the financial domain.

The journey to develop Blnk V1 has been long, filled with weekends and holidays dedicated to this labor of love. But the outcome is something I am profoundly proud of. Blnk V1 is not just a tool; it’s a community, a learning platform, and a stepping stone towards a more innovative financial internet.

If Blnk resonates with you, I encourage you to join our community. Whether you're looking to contribute, learn, or simply connect with like-minded individuals.

Warm regards, 
Jerry
