I'm Jerry, and I've been working in financial services for years - it's a field I'm truly passionate about. Developing new financial products is an exciting journey that starts off straightforward but gets incredibly complex the deeper you go. It's a level of complexity that can only be fully understood through hands-on experience.

About two years ago, I started a project called Blnk to capture my own knowledge and experience into a tool for building financial products. Blnk is essentially an open-source ledger that aims to reflect best practices in financial product development.

My decision to make Blnk open source wasn't just about providing a useful tool, but driving a community of builders in the financial space. I want Blnk to help others develop better products, sure, but I also hope it fosters a culture of sharing insights and learnings.

The goal is for Blnk to promote innovation by having financial professionals contribute their own expertise back into the tool itself. With an open platform, we can collectively raise the bar for quality financial products and capabilities across the industry. It's about more than just having a great tool - it's about tapping into the power of community-driven knowledge sharing.

I hope you find Blnk useful.

Regards,
Jerry
