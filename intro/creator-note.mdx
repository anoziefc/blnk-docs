Hi there,

I'm Jerry, the creator of Blnk.

Building great financial products is hard, but it shouldn't be.

I've been working in the financial services industry for almost a decade. It is an exciting journey that starts off really simple, but very quickly becomes complex as you dig deeper, introducing you to a level of complexity that can only be understood through hands-on experience.

This was the norm, and I didn't like it. It's too risky to build financial products without sufficient system-level understanding of how things should work.

So, in 2022, I started Blnk, a project to document all of my knowledge and experience — in banking and payments operations, software engineering, and product development — into a tool for building financial products. 

I created Blnk to help developers like me, all around the world, build and implement world-class features, processes and best practices in their application without dealing with the arduous task of figuring it out alone. 

>Blnk is **an open-source ledger** uniquely designed to manage the complexity of financial products, offering advanced knowledge and tools for seamless application development and collaboration with internal and external departments.

I made it open-source because Blnk isn't just a tool; I also want to drive a community of builders in the financial services space. While I want it to help you build better products, I also hope it fosters a culture of sharing insights and providing support through community driven knowledge.

With Blnk, it is possible to collectively raise the bar for building quality financial technology in the industry.

I hope you find it useful.

👌🏽 Cheers.
