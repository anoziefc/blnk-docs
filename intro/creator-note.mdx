Hi there,

I'm Jerry, the creator of Blnk.

Building great financial products is hard, but it shouldn't be.

I've been working in the financial services industry for almost a decade. It is an exciting journey that starts off really simple, but very quickly becomes complex as you dig deeper, introducing you to a level of complexity that can only be understood through hands-on experience.

This was the norm, and I didn't like it. It's too risky to build financial products without sufficient system-level understanding of how things should work.

So, in 2022, I started Blnk, a project to document all of my knowledge and experience ‚Äî in banking and payments operations, software engineering, and product development ‚Äî into a tool for building financial products. 

I created Blnk to help developers like me, all around the world, build and implement world-class features, processes and best practices in their application without dealing with the arduous task of figuring it out alone. 

>Blnk is **an open-source ledger** uniquely designed to manage the complexity of financial products, offering advanced knowledge and tools for seamless application development and collaboration with internal and external departments.

As an open-source project, Blnk represents a culture ‚Äî a way of building financial products that care for users ‚Äî and I invite you to join a community of professionals helping each other develop better applications, offer insights and provide support through community-driven knowledge sharing. With Blnk, we can collectively raise the bar for deploying quality financial technology across the industry.

I hope Blnk excites you as much as it excites me.

üëåüèΩ Cheers.

I'm Jerry, and I've been working in financial services for years - it's a field I'm truly passionate about. Developing new financial products is an exciting journey that starts off straightforward but gets incredibly complex the deeper you go. It's a level of complexity that can only be fully understood through hands-on experience.

About two years ago, I started a project called Blnk to capture my own knowledge and experience into a tool for building financial products. Blnk is essentially an open-source ledger that aims to reflect best practices in financial product development.

My decision to make Blnk open source wasn't just about providing a useful tool, but driving a community of builders in the financial space. I want Blnk to help others develop better products, sure, but I also hope it fosters a culture of sharing insights and learnings.

The goal is for Blnk to promote innovation by having financial professionals contribute their own expertise back into the tool itself. With an open platform, we can collectively raise the bar for quality financial products and capabilities across the industry. It's about more than just having a great tool - it's about tapping into the power of community-driven knowledge sharing.

I hope you find Blnk useful.

Regards,
Jerry
