Hi there,

I'm Jerry, the creator of Blnk.

Building great financial products is hard, but it shouldn't be.

I started the Blnk Ledger in 2022 because I’ve been building financial services for almost a decade and I’ve learnt so much doing so. It is an exciting journey that starts off really simple, but very quickly becomes complex as you dig deeper.

I discovered that in today's world of Digital, especially money, software engineers are the new custodians of these monies and they are expected to ensure it moves fast and is stored securely — making sure the company's ledgers and books make sense.

New financial applications are launched daily as the world becomes more transactional. But there are very little resources and tools to help software engineers build better and sustainable solutions for these applications.

FinTech engineering is a field filled with a lot to learn, and I want to share some of my experience and learnings by open sourcing the Blnk Ledger. Ledgers are the core of most financial products and there was no better place to start. 

If you'd like to learn more about ledgers or contribute to the body of work, please [join our Discord server.](https://discord.gg/7WNv94zPpx)

I hope, with Blnk, we're able to collectively raise the bar for building quality financial technology in the industry.

👌🏽 Cheers.
