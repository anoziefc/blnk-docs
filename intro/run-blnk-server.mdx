title: Run Blnk Server
description: How to deploy the Blnk server
---
## Overview

Deploy Blnk to get access of Blnk's features and begin using it.

To get started, you need a basic understanding of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) â€” essential tools for deploying containerized applications like Blnk.

<Note>
     **Prerequisites:**
     - Docker 20.10.11 or later
     - Compose 1.29.2 or later
</Note>

## Deployment steps

<Steps>
	<Step title="Clone Blnk to your local server or computer">
		Clone the open-source repository to your local environment. This will create a copy of the latest Blnk source code on your machine.
		
		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/jerry-enebeli/Blnk && cd Blnk
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create a configuration file">
		Create a configuration file called `blnk.json`. This file will contain essential settings for running your Blnk server.
		
		```bash
		touch blnk.json
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Configure your Blnk server">
		Open the `blnk.json` file you've just created, copy and save the following JSON into it. You don't need to edit the details of this configuration.
		
		You can edit the webhook_url for your Slack workspace. Check out [Handling notifications](notifications) to learn how to add your webhook configuration to this file.
		
		```json
		{
		  "project_name": "Blnk",
		  "data_source": {
		    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
		  },
		  "redis": {
		    "dns": "redis:6379"
		  },
		  "server": {
		    "domain": "blnk.io",
		    "ssl": false,
		    "ssl_email": "jerryenebeli@gmail.com",
		    "port": "5001"
		  },
		  "notification": {
		    "slack": {
		      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com"
		    }
		  }
		}
		
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Start your Blnk server with Docker Compose">
		With your configuration file in place, you can now start the Blnk server using Docker Compose. This pulls the required Docker images, create containers, and starts the services defined in your Docker Compose file.
		
		```bash
		docker compose up
		```
		
		After executing the command, Docker Compose will automatically handle the deployment of the Blnk server. 
		
		Once the process is complete, your Blnk server will be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5001`.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## You're ready!

Once your server is successfully running, it's time to explore what Blnk can do.
