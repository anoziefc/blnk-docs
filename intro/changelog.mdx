<Accordion title="Blnk v0.6.0 — Advanced control over transactions">
	Date: Apr 7, 2024
	### Multiple sources & destinations

	<Frame caption="Simplified flow of how multiple sources work">

	</Frame>
	
	You can now process transactions from multiple sources to one destination or from one source to multiple destinations. Multiple sources/destinations help you link similar transactions into one single request payload and making the process a lot more efficient for you. 
	
	Go to [Multiple sources](/ledger/tutorial/multiple-sources) to learn how to record your first multi-source transaction on Blnk.

	### Introducing inflight

	`inflight` is a transaction parameter that lets you instruct Blnk to hold the transaction amount in a holding balance until a condition set by your application has been met. When you initiate an inflight transaction, its status stays in `INFLIGHT` until you instruct Blnk to either continue or void the transaction.

	Here are some ways we believe Inflight is useful:

	- **For managing KYC limits:** When an account crosses its KYC limits determined by your application, you can hold all deposits with inflight until the user's KYC is updated.
	- **For escrow:** Inflight allows you to easily implement escrow features in your application, allowing your users see the amount being held (but not available to them to spend).
	- **For card payouts:** Hold amounts in an inflight balance until the card is authorized by the payment processor for successful payment.  
	- **For external payouts:** Hold amount in an inflight balance while your payout is being processed by your provider; only release it when the transaction is successful or failed.

	Here's other things we fixed:

	### New & improved
		1. We now apply the `precision` value for a ledger balance to the amounts of all transactions that the ledger balance is a part of. This makes sure that your total balance is correctly computed and no amount is lost to approximation.
		2. Implemented "optimistic locking" as a concurrency control mechanism. This allows multiple transactions to proceed concurrently without locking resources. **See also → [Managing concurrency](/ledger/guide/queuing-transactions).**
		3. You can now process transactions from a ledger balance even if they do not have sufficient funds. With Overdraft, you can compute a negative balance (representing that more funds have been paid out than paid in on the ledger balance).
		4. General bug and performance improvements

<Accordion title="Blnk v0.5.0 — Our first release">
	Date: Apr 1, 2024
	### Welcome to our first release
		
	Blnk is now live and ready for you to try out in your applications.
	
	In this version, you have all you need to set up a basic ledger for your applications. You can create a ledger, create balances, record transactions, schedule those transactions, and initiate a refund for a particular transaction where required.
	
	We introduced [Balance Precision](/ledger/tutorial/precision) — a way to keep your ledger balances consistent and accurate in your ledger.
	
	<Frame caption="A simplified overview of how the Blnk Ledger works">
		<img src="/images/blnk-ledger-overview.png" />
	</Frame>
	
	You can use the Blnk Ledger to:
	
	1. View a high level overview of every transaction activity happening in your financial application.
	2. Organize the money movement workflows of your organization's internal account balances.	
	3. Guarantee that you can trace and explain any anomaly in your ledger.
	
	To get started, jump to the Blnk Ledger section in the side navigation bar.
