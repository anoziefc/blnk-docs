The query field, `q`, is used to query your ledger data. The query field is required in all search request payloads that you send to search endpoint.

When providing a search term to query, use the `query_by` to specify what field(s) it should search from. See example below:

```json Request
{
    "q": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "query_by": "source"
}
```

The above request will return results where the specified `balance_id` is in the source field. To query by more fields, use commas to separate the fields you want to search in. 

See example below:

```json Request
{
    "q": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "query_by": "source,destination"
}
```

To return all documents in the collection without searching for a specific query text, you can use `*` as the query field's value.

```json request
{
    "q": "*"
}
```
