If your ledger is self-hosted, you need to sync the data on your ledger to your Cloud account, and we use the Blnk CLI to manage this sync. 

Use the `blnk cloud sync` command to manage all sync actions in the CLI.

## 1. Start a cloud sync

To start a cloud sync running in the background:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud sync start
```
```sh Output
Starting sync process in the background...
Sync process PID: 43691
Sync logs will be written to <filepath>/blnk-cli/sync.log
```

<Tip>
    Navigate to the sync logs to see how your sync is performing.
</Tip>

You can also confirm the status of your sync:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud sync status
```
```sh Output
Sync status: Running
```

## 2. Stop a cloud sync

To stop or pause a cloud sync:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud sync stop
```
```sh Output
Sync process stopped
```
