Sometimes, you need to refund a transaction. Blnk allows you to process a refund using the `transaction_id` of the original transaction.

Refunds only happen on transactions that have been applied. This means that the participating balances have been updated with the transaction amount from the original transaction.

When you refund a transaction, Blnk creates a new transaction record and switches the `source` and `destination` balances of the original transaction â€” debiting the amount from the balance that initially received it and crediting it to the balance that initially sent it.

## Applying refunds

Use the **refund-transaction** endpoint and pass the transaction_id of the transaction that you want to refund.

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/refund-transaction/{transaction_id}
```
