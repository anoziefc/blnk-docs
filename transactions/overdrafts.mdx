To send money, the `source` is required to have enough funds to execute the transaction. If Blnk detects insufficent funds, the transaction is rejected. 

However, there are certain transaction workflows that do not fit this default requirement.

## What is overdrafts?

Overdrafts is a Blnk feature that lets you successfully record a transaction regardless of the `source`'s balance. When overdrafts is enabled, the transaction is processed and the balance (if insufficent) is allowed to go negative. 

<Tip>
    A very popular use-case for overdrafts is lending. You can also use it for [internal balances](../balances/internal-balances) that do not have a starting balance such as `@World`.

2. [Some real-life applications](#2-some-real-life-applications)

## 1. Enabling overdrafts

Overdrafts are applied when recording a transacton. To enable overdraft, include the `allow_overdraft` parameter and set its value to `true` in your request body:

```json Request
{
    "amount": 112.30,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref-ghwe12009",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "@World",
    "destination": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {
      "account_type": "savings"
    }
}
```

## 2. Some real-life applications

1. **Loans and credit facilities:** You can easily implement lending features, track how much a customer has spent outside of their available balance, manage credit history, etc., and record it all in your Blnk Ledger.

2. **Internal money movement:** Your internal balances can often face fluctuations in cash flow, especially during unpredictable periods. Overdrafts allow you to efficiently manage this without disrupting your financial operation.
