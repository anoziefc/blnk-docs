Blnk supports scheduling a transaction for a later specified date. This can be useful for both one-time or recurring transactions that need to automatically happen at a certain date in the future.

<Note>
    All dates and times in Blnk are stored in the UTC timezone.

## 1. Scheduling a transaction

To schedule a transaction, include the `scheduled_for` field in your request body when calling the **record-transaction** endpoint.

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@fees",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-02-20 05:28:03",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

```json Response
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "destination": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "reference": "ref",
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "precise_amount": 10000000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-10-08T19:48:00",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

Blnk accepts and adds the transaction to its queue. Once the scheduled time is reached, the transaction gets applied and you receive a notification via the `transaction.applied` webhook event.
