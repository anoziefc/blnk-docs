## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement and track scheduled savings deposit with the Blnk ledger. Here's what we'll do:

1. Create a customer savings wallet balance.
2. Initiate a scheduled deposit transaction. For one-time funding: [Wallet Funding Tutorial →](/tutorials/quick-start/wallet-management#funding-the-main-wallet).
3. Update the savings frequency.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the [Blnk TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/introduction) for the implementation. If you prefer, you can also refer to the [API reference](/reference/create-ledger) for details on the available endpoints.

## Designing your map

Before writing code, it's crucial to design a [money movement map](/ledgers/money-movement-map) that outlines how money moves in your system. This serves as the blueprint for your implementation.

For our scheduled savings deposit workflow, here's our map:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    external([@WorldUSD])
    savings([Savings Wallet])

    external -- Scheduled --> savings
```

## Set up your implementation

Based on our map, we'll implement the following steps:

1. Initiate a scheduled transaction to `Savings Wallet`
2. Monitor the date of the next scheduled deposit to ensure timely execution.
3. Set up a new scheduled transaction after the current one has been successfully processed.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. A running Blnk server instance (e.g. at `http://localhost:5001`).
2. An API key for Blnk (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code examples) or you can leave it blank.
3. The [Blnk CLI](/blnk-cli/install) installed or a connected [Blnk Cloud](https://cloud.blnkfinance.com) workspace to view your ledger data.
4. A customer savings ledger to organise the customers' savings balances. Learn how: [How to Create a Ledger →](/tutorials/quick-start/wallet-management#create-customer-ledger)

## Create customer savings balance

Create a balance with the `ledger_id` of your `Customer Savings Ledger` to represent your customer savings wallet:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function createSavingsWallet(savingsLedgerId, identityId, currency) {
  const blnk = await getBlnkInstance();
  const { LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  const savingsWallet = await LedgerBalances.create({
    ledger_id: savingsLedgerId,
    identity_id: identityId,
    currency: currency,
    meta_data: {
      wallet_type: "savings",
      recurring: true,
      frequency: "monthly",
      next_scheduled_savings: ""
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Savings Wallet created:", savingsWallet.data.balance_id);
  return savingsWallet.data.balance_id;
}
```
```bash cURL {5-6}
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/balances \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
--data '{
    "ledger_id": "<customer-savings-ledger-id>",
    "identity_id": "<customer-identity-id>",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        wallet_type: "savings",
        recurring: true,
        frequency: "monthly",
        next_scheduled_savings: ""
    }
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a savings balance with a set of default metadata:

1. This customer balance is subscribed to scheduled deposits.
2. Schedule frequency is monthly.
3. The next scheduled savings date can be monitored on the customer balance
