Learn how to deploy the Blnk server efficiently. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Docker and Compose, essential tools for deploying containerized applications.

<Info>
    **Prerequisite**
    - Docker 20.10.11 or later
    - Compose 1.29.2 or later
</Info>

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone Blnk to Your Local Server or Computer

Start by cloning the Blnk repository to your local environment. This will create a copy of the latest Blnk source code on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerry-enebeli/Blnk && cd Blnk
```

### Step 2: Create a Configuration File

Next, you'll need to create a configuration file named `blnk.json`. This file contains essential settings for running your Blnk server.

```bash
touch blnk.json
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Blnk Server

Open the `blnk.json` file you just created and copy the following JSON configuration into it. Make sure to adjust the settings according to your environment and needs, such as the `time_zone`, database credentials (`data_source`), and any other specific configurations you require.

```json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "time_zone": "UTC",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "account_number_generation": {
    "enable_auto_generation": true,
    "http_service": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5001/mocked-account",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer some_auth_token"
      }
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "domain": "blnk.io",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_email": "jerryenebeli@gmail.com",
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "url": "http://server:5001/webhooks",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Start Your Blnk Server with Docker Compose

With your configuration file in place, you're now ready to start the Blnk server using Docker Compose. This will pull the necessary Docker images, create containers, and start the services defined in your Docker Compose file.

```bash
docker compose up
```

After executing the command, Docker Compose will handle the deployment of the Blnk server. Once the process is complete, the Blnk server should be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5001`.

## Next Steps

With your Blnk server running, you're now ready to explore its features and start integrating it into your financial applications. Consider diving into the Blnk documentation to learn more about creating ledgers, managing transactions, and leveraging the full capabilities of your new open-source ledger system.
