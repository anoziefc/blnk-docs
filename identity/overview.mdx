Identity allows you to attach your balance to an identity, ensuring every transaction activity is traceable, structured and owned by an entity. Whether it's individual customers or larger organizations, every transaction can be attributed to a specific entity, enhancing transparency and accountability.

In this guide, we'll learn how to associate a balance with an identity, and ensure clear attribution of financial activities. 

## 1. Linking an identity to a balance
### Create an identity

To link an identity to a balance, the identity (individual or organization) must be created and stored in Blnk. Upon creation, every identity is assigned a unique `identity_id`.

### Create a balance with an identity

When creating a new balance, you can link it to an existing identity by passing the `identity_id` in the balance creation payload. Here's a sample payload to create a balance and link it to an identity:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances
```

```json Request
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_db5eabf0-4152-47cf-8353-d1729a491962",
    "identity_id": "idt_0501db5c-baf9-4be1-a931-f4bae7f3a41d",
    "currency": "NGN"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ledger_id` | The unique ID of the ledger where the balance is to be created. |
| `identity_id` | The unique ID of the identity you want to link to the balance. |
| `currency` | The currency of the balance. |

Once the balance is created with the above payload, it will be intrinsically linked to the specified identity through the `identity_id`.

This link ensures that all transactions and activities associated with this balance can be traced back to the specified identity, adding an extra layer of transparency to the financial operations in Blnk.
