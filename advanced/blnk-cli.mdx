The Blnk CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to interact directly with your Blnk Ledger or any remote instance of a Blnk Ledger from your terminal. You get access to a suite of commands to read, manage and configure your ledger efficiently. 

## Prerequisites

To use the Blnk CLI, ensure you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm. If you don't have them, visit the [Node official website](https://nodejs.org/) to download.
2. A running instance of Blnk

<Info>
    If you haven't installed the Blnk Ledger, read [our installation guide](/intro/run-blnk-server) to get started. 
</Info>

## Installation

To install the Blnk CLI tool, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash bash
npm i -g blnk-cli
```

This installs the Blnk CLI globally on your system, allowing you to access it from anywhere.

## Confirm installation

To confirm that you have installed it, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash bash
blnk --version
```

This commmand should display the installed version of the Blnk CLI.

## Basic Usage

Here are some basic commands to get you started. Ensure your Blnk Ledger is running before you start running these commands.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Connect to a different instance">
        ```bash bash
        blnk connect <url>
        ```
        This command allows the Blnk CLI to connect and manage a different instance outside of your machine. It is unprotected, however.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Securely connect to a different instance">
        ```bash bash
        blnk connect-secure <url> <token>
        ```
        This command ensures a secure connection to a different instance using its secret key (token) as authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="View all ledgers">
        ```bash bash
        blnk view-ledgers
        ```
        This command displays a table of all the ledgers in your Blnk Ledger.
    </Step>
    <Step title="View all balances">
        ```bash bash
        blnk view-balances
        ```
        This command displays a table of all the ledger balances in your Blnk Ledger.
    </Step>
    <Step title="View all transactions">
        ```bash bash
        blnk view-transactions
        ```
        This command displays a table of all the transactions in your Blnk Ledger.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Help manual">
        ```bash bash
        blnk help
        ```
        This command displays a list of all the commands and their function. To find the help manual for a particular command, run the following command:
        ```bash bash
        blnk help [command]
        ```    
    </Step>
</Steps>
