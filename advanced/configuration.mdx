To successfully [run your Blnk server](../home/install) and start to use Blnk, you need to set your configuration settings to make sure things work properly.

To do this, you need to create a `blnk.json` file in the root directory of the git repository, and copy & paste the JSON below into it.

```json blnk.json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "server": {
    "domain": "blnk.io",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_email": "jerryenebeli@gmail.com",
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com"
    }
  }
}

```

- `project_name`: Specifies the name of your Blnk Ledger project.
- `data_source`:
	- `dns`: Specifies the DNS or connection string to the database. It includes details such as the username, password, host, port, and database name. In this config file, it connects to a PostgreSQL database named "blnk" with SSL mode disabled.
- `redis`:
	- `dns`: Specifies the DNS or connection string to the Redis server. It includes the host and port details. In this config file, it connects to a Redis server running on the default port (6379).
- `server`:
	- `domain`: Your domain name to be associated with the server.
	- `ssl`: Indicates whether SSL is enabled or not.
	- `ssl_email`: Email address associated with your SSL certificates.
	- `port`: Specifies the port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections. In this example, it is set to "5001".
- `notification`:
	- `slack`: Sends error notifications to Slack.
		- `webhook_url`: The webhook URL provided by your Slack workspace.
