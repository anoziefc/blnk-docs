Blnk's fraud detection module is designed to compute a "fraud score" for financial transactions, providing a risk assessment metric. This documentation section will delve deep into the algorithm behind this essential feature.

## **Constants Overview**
These are the current constants taken into account for the normalization. These figure can be set in your `blnk.json` config file.
- **maxChangeFrequency**: Maximum number of transactions observed in a day for any account.
- **maxTransactionAmount**: Highest transaction value recorded across all accounts.
- **maxBalance**: Peak account balance observed in the system.
- **maxCreditBalance**: Maximum credit balance ever recorded.
- **maxDebitBalance**: Largest debit balance observed.

```json blnk.config
{
  "normalization_constants": {
    "maxChangeFrequency": 10,
    "maxTransactionAmount": 300,
    "maxBalance": 200000000,
    "maxCreditBalance": 100000000,
    "maxDebitBalance": 100000000
  }
}
```

## **Normalization Process**
Normalization standardizes varying financial parameters to a scale of 0-1, where 0 represents no or minimal risk and 1 signifies the highest possible risk. The function:

```pseudo
function normalize(value, min=0, max) {
    return (value - min) / (max - min)
}
```
is employed for this purpose. This ensures each parameter contributes proportionally to the final fraud score.

### **Fraud Score Computation**

1. **Input Normalization**: Parameters like transaction amount, balance, etc., are normalized using the constants.
2. **Weight Assignment**: Each normalized parameter gets a weight, defining its influence on the final score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The fraud score is the sum of the product of each parameter and its weight, ensuring it remains between 0 (minimal risk) and 1 (maximum risk).

## **Applying Blnk's Fraud Detection Module**

### **Using the `risk_tolerance_threshold` Field**:

1. **risk_tolerance_threshold**:
 - Type: Float (Range: 0 to 1)
 - Description: Represents the maximum acceptable risk level for the transaction. A score of `0` indicates no risk, while a score of `1` denotes maximum risk. By setting this value, you instruct the system to evaluate the transaction's risk level and compare it against your threshold.
 - Example: If you set `risk_tolerance_threshold` to `0.7`, any transaction with a computed fraud score above 0.7 will be flagged or denied, while transactions with a score of 0.7 or below will be processed.

## **Steps to Apply Fraud Detection**:

1. **Initiate a Transaction**:
 - When initiating a financial transaction, include all necessary fields in the JSON payload, such as `amount`, `description`, `reference`, `drcr`, `currency`, and `balance_id`.

2. **Include `risk_tolerance_threshold`**:
 - Decide on the maximum risk you're willing to accept for this transaction.
 - Add the `risk_tolerance_threshold` field to your transaction payload and set it to your chosen value.

3. **Process the Transaction**:
 - Send the transaction payload to Blnk's system.
 - Blnk's fraud detection module will compute the transaction's fraud score.
 - If the computed score is below or equal to your specified `risk_tolerance_threshold`, the transaction will proceed. Otherwise, it will be flagged or denied based on the system's configured response to high-risk transactions.

4. **Review and Respond**:
 - For flagged transactions, review the details and decide whether to approve or deny them. You can adjust the `risk_tolerance_threshold` for future transactions based on your comfort level and observed transaction patterns.

**Note**: Adjusting the `risk_tolerance_threshold` allows you to fine-tune the sensitivity of the fraud detection system. A lower value makes the system more stringent, flagging more transactions, while a higher value makes it more lenient.
