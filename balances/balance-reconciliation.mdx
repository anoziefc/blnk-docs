## Overview

Balance Reconciliation verifies accuracy by recalculating a balance from its transactions to ensure it correctly reflects all recorded activity. It also ensures that the ledger remains a reliable source of truth by identifying and correcting discrepancies.

Unlike [Historical Balances](/balances/historical-balances), which only computes and displays balances, **Balance Reconciliation** also applies corrections directly to your ledger when discrepancies are found, such as when the balance has been modified without authorization.

## Running a balance reconciliation

To reconcile a balance, update its metadata with the following request:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/{balance_id}/metadata
```
```json
{
  "meta_data": {
    "BLNK_RUN_RECONCILIATION": "SOURCE"
  }
}
```

---

## Verifying the results

To check the reconciliation results, retrieve  the balance details with the [Get Balance](/reference/get-balance) endpoint:

```
GET https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}
```

The reconciliation results will be available in the `meta_data` object:

```json Response
{
  "meta_data": {
    "BLNK_RECONCILIATION_RESULT": {
      "difference": "103842",
      "executed_at": "2025-03-16 22:55:34.281624+00",
      "previous_balance": "600",
      "previous_credit": "1200",
      "previous_debit": "600",
      "recalculated_balance": "104442",
      "recalculated_credit": "119600",
      "recalculated_debit": "15158"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `difference` | The discrepancy between the previous balance and the recalculated balance. |
| `executed_at` | The timestamp when the reconciliation was performed. |
| `previous_balance` | The balance recorded before reconciliation. |
| `previous_credit` | The total credit amount recorded before reconciliation. |
| `previous_debit` | The total debit amount recorded before reconciliation. |
| `recalculated_balance` | The corrected balance after reconciliation. |
| `recalculated_credit` | The total credit amount after recalculating from transactions. |
| `recalculated_debit` | The total debit amount after recalculating from transactions. |

### Key considerations

1. If the `difference` is zero, the balance was already accurate.
2. If the `difference` is non-zero, the ledger has been updated to reflect the corrected balance.
