Transaction statuses refer to the different states of a single transaction in its lifecycle. 

<Note>
    A transaction is initiated when money moves from a source to a destination.

**Let's get started ✨**

What we'll cover …

1. [Primary transaction statuses](#1-primary-transaction-statuses)
2. [Inflight statuses](#2-inflight-statuses)

## 1. Primary transaction statuses

There are three main primary transaction statuses for any transaction in Blnk.

1. `QUEUED`: This is the default status for any new transaction record. It means your transaction record has been accepted by Blnk, added to a queue and is waiting to be applied. See also: [How Blnk handles concurrency](../advanced/concurrency).

2. `APPLIED`: Your transaction status is updated to "applied" when the balances of the source and destination of the transaction get updated, with the transaction amount debited and credited respectively. A transaction with the `APPLIED` is deemed to completed its lifecycle.

    <Info>
        There is no `SUCCESSFUL` status in the ledger. A successful payment on the outside is represented as `APPLIED` in your ledger.
    </Info>

3. `REJECTED`: Your transaction status is updated to "rejected" if any of the conditions required for a successful transaction hasn't been met.

## 2. Inflight statuses

[Inflight](inflight) is a feature that allows you to set conditions to be met before a transaction is applied in your ledger. It is also sometimes known as a "2-phase commit."

1. `INFLIGHT`: Your transaction status is updated to "inflight" when inflight is enabled for the transaction in the request body. A transaction in inflight will remain there and not be applied until the set condition is satisfied or the transaction expires.

2. `COMMIT`: Commit is a status specific to the **update inflight** endpoint. When you send a "commit" status for an inflight transaction, it means that the transaction has met the set inflight conditions and can now be applied. 

3. `VOID`: Void is a status also specific to the **update-inflight** endpoint. When you send a "void" status for an inflight transaction, it means that the transaction didn't meet the conditions and should not be applied. 

<Warning>
    All transactions in Blnk are uni-directional. Once a transaction has been applied, committed or voided, you cannot roll back the status to its previous status. 
    
    This is important to protect the correctness and accuracy of the transaction and your ledger as a whole.
