This is your guide to getting started with Blnk. If you are new to Blnk or [open-source fintech developer tools](https://blnkfinance.com), this is where you should start.

## What is Blnk?

Blnk offers an open-source financial ledger database for building and scaling fintech products. With Blnk, you can:

- Accurately [record transactions](../start/record-transactions) in your system.
- Correctly [manage complex flow of funds](../ledgers/money-movement-map) and transaction data.
- Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

**Let's get started ✨**

What we'll cover …

1. [Install Blnk on your machine](#1-install-blnk-on-your-machine)
2. [Install the Blnk CLI](#2-install-the-blnk-cli)
3. [Launch Blnk](#3-launch-blnk)
4. [Create your first ledger](#4-create-your-first-ledger)
5. [Create your first balance](#5-create-your-first-balance)
6. [Record your first transaction](#6-record-first-transaction)

## 1. Install Blnk on your machine

To install Blnk, make sure you have Docker and Compose installed and running on your machine.

To get started with Blnk, first clone the repository into your machine:

```bash bash
git clone https://github.com/blnkledger/Blnk && cd Blnk
```

Next, create a configuration file, `blnk.json`:

```bash bash
touch blnk.json
```

Then copy and save the following configuration:

```json blnk.json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "server": {
    "domain": "blnk.io",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_email": "jerryenebeli@gmail.com",
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Install the Blnk CLI

To use the Blnk CLI, you need to first have Node.js and npm downloaded on your machine. 

To install the CLI, install the npm package:

```bash bash
npm i -g blnk-cli
```

Next, confirm your installation:

```bash bash
blnk --version
```

This command should display the installed version of the CLI.

[Read our full guide on how to use the Blnk CLI](../advanced/blnk-cli)

## 3. Launch Blnk

Start your Blnk server with Docker compose:

```bash bash
docker compose up
```

If successful, you should see the following:

## 4. Create your first ledger

Everything in Blnk begins with a ledger. Ledgers are used to group and manage how we arrange our [ledger balances](#5-create-your-first-balance) in our application.

When you install Blnk, an internal ledger called [the General Ledger](../ledgers/general-ledger) is created for you. This is a ledger meant for grouping all of the balances directly owned by your organization, e.g., Revenue, etc.

However, to create, store and represent balances for accounts/wallets owned by the users in your application, it is required to create ledgers to group them in.

To create a ledger, call the ["create-ledger endpoint"](/misc/create-ledger) with the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "meta_data": {
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```
```json Response
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
    "meta_data":{
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `name` | A name that best describes the function of the ledger | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the ledger being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | --- 
		| `ledger_id` | Unique identification number for your ledger | `string`
		| `name` | The name of your ledger | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of when it was created | `string`
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 5. Create your first balance

Ledger balances (or balances for short) are used to represent store of value in a fintech application, e.g., wallet, account, card balance, etc. They represent the source or destination of a transaction record.

To create a balance, call the ["create-balance endpoint"](/misc/create-balance) with the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```
```json Response
{
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "balance": 0,
    "version": 0,
    "inflight_balance": 0,
    "credit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
    "debit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
    "precision": 0,
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "identity_id": "",
    "indicator": "",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:33:01.311600208Z",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `ledger_id` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to. | Yes | `string`
		| `currency` | The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded. | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the balance being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `balance_id` | The unique id of the balance you created. | `string`
		| `balance` | Sum of `credit_balance` and `debit_balance`. | `int64`
		| `inflight_balance` | Sum of `inflight_credit_balance` and `inflight_debit_balance`. | `int64`
		| `credit_balance` | Sum of all credit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_credit_balance` | Total amount waiting to be added to your balance. | `int64`
		| `debit_balance` | Sum of all debit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_debit_balance` | Total amount waiting to be deducted from your balance. | `int64`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of creation. | `string`
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 6. Record your first transaction

Transactions represent all financial activities happening in your application. Blnk uses the [double entry principle](../guides/double-entry) to record transactions, i.e., to successfully record a transaction, there must be a source and a destination.

To record a transaction, call the ["record-transaction endpoint"](/misc/record-transaction) with the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "amount": 750,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "precision": 100,
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "Sent from app",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```
```json Response
