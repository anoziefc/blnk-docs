A money movement map is a group of all <Tooltip tip="How money moves between balances from initiation to its final destination.">transaction journeys</Tooltip> in your system. 

It is crucial to have clarity on how the flow of funds behave within your application, because it helps you define how to set up your ledger and track a <Tooltip tip="Any action that triggers a transaction in your system">transaction activity</Tooltip> through its entire journey.

## Before you start

<Tip>For best results, always create your money movement map collaboratively with all relevant stakeholders. This ensures business processes are properly integrated and reduces friction between teams.</Tip>

Some of these key stakeholders include:

- **Product & Engineering:** Owns the technical implementation of money flows, ensuring the architecture supports all required functionality and integrations.
- **Finance:** Sets the rules for accounting treatment of transactions and defines what financial data/reports are needed.
- **Reconciliation:** Creates processes to match transactions across systems and handle settlement discrepancies.
- **Treasury:** Manages cash positions and handles actual movement of funds between accounts/partners.
- **Operations:** Establishes day-to-day processes for transaction handling and control procedures.
- **Data analytics:** Defines reporting needs and metrics to track money movement effectiveness.

What we'll cover …

1. [Defining your use case](#1-defining-your-use-case)
2. [Transaction journeys](#2-transaction-journeys)
3. [Applying your money movement map](#3-applying-your-money-movement-map)

## 1. Defining your use case

To draw an accurate money movement map, you need to define your product's use cases and priorities. Consider 2 fintechs:

| Fintech | Services | Priorities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Wallets | Only wants to track how its wallets are performing. |
| B | Wallets | Wants the same thing as fintech A, but also wants to track every external account that their users transact with. |

## 2. Transaction journeys

A transaction journey refers to all the nodes money flows through when a transaction is initiated in your system. For a wallet, you can have at least 2 journeys:

- Wallet funding
- Wallet withdrawal

### Wallet funding for fintech A

Case scenario: When a user funds their wallet, they pay a processing fee.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id0(((Start)))
    id1(((End)))
    id2([@World])
    id3([User balance])
    id4([@Fees])
    id0 --- id2
    id2 -- User receives funds --> id3
    id2 -- User pays processing fee --> id4
    id3 --- id1
    id4 --- id1
```

<Info>
    Balances with an "@" prefix are called [internal balances](/balances/internal-balances). They refer to balances owned by the organization. They are automatically grouped in the [General Ledger](/ledgers/general-ledger).
</Info>

In the flowchart above, @World represents all external accounts (cards, other bank accounts, etc.) interacting with your users’ balances.

### Wallet funding for fintech B

Case scenario: Fintech B wants to track every external account that has funded the wallet.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id0(((Start)))
    id1(((End)))
    id2([external-account])
    id3([User balance])
    id4([@Fees])
    id0 --- id2
    id2 -- User receives funds --> id3
    id3 -- Processing fee is debited --> id4
    id4 --- id1
```

Unlike fintech A that groups them all into a single balance, in this case, a separate balance is created for each unique external account that has funded the wallet. This allows fintech B to have deeper insights into which external account interacts often with the user's balance.

### Wallet withdrawal for fintech A

Case scenario: When a user withdraws from their wallet, they pay a processing fee.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id0(((Start)))
    id1(((End)))
    id2([@World])
    id3([User balance])
    id4([@Fees])
    id0 --- id3
    id3 -- User sends money out --> id2
    id3 -- User pays processing fee --> id4
    id2 --- id1
    id4 --- id1
```

### Wallet withdrawal for fintech B

Case scenario: Fintech B wants to track every external account that has withdrawn from the wallet.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id0(((Start)))
    id1(((End)))
    id2([external-account])
    id3([User balance])
    id4([@Fees])
    id0 --- id3
    id3 -- User sends money out --> id2
    id3 -- Processing fee is debited --> id4
    id4 --- id1
    id2 --- id1
```

## 3. Applying your money movement map

With your transaction journeys clearly defined, you can use this information to set up your Blnk Ledger.

### Setting up fintech A ledger

Fintech A only needs to create one ledger to group all of its users' balances. `@World` and `@Fees` are automatically added to the [General Ledger](/ledgers/general-ledger).

| Ledgers | Ledger balances |
| :--- | :--- |
| General ledger | @Fees | 
| Customer wallets ledger | user-A-balance |
| | user-B-balance |
| | user-C-balance |
| | user-D-balance |

### Setting up fintech B ledger

Fintech B needs to create a ledger for each user. The ledger groups the user's balance managed by the fintech and all external balances that has funded/withdrawn from the user's balance. 

| Ledgers | Ledger balances |
| :--- | :--- |
| General ledger | @Fees | 
| User A ledger | user-balance |
|  | external-account-1 |
|  | external-account-2 |
|  | external-account-n |
| User B ledger | user-balance |
|  | external-account-1 |
|  | external-account-2 |
|  | external-account-3 |
|  | external-account-4 |
|  | external-account-n |
