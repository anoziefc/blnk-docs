## Introducing Search
	
Search gives you full control and flexibility over how you fetch your transaction data from your Blnk Ledger. You can use Search to retrieve any data — ledgers, ledger balances, and transactions — from your Blnk Ledger. Blnk uses [Typesense](https://typesense.org) to handle fetching data from your ledger allowing you to efficiently display data in your application, easily track balances and transactions, and filter specific information needed from your ledger for investigation.
	
Go to [Search Blnk - Overview](/ledger/tutorial/search/overview) to explore Search.

## Set precision when recording transactions

You can now set a `precision` value in your transaction request payload.

Blnk uses `precision` to convert transaction amounts to the lowest unit possible, e.g., converting naira to kobo, to ensure that your balances are correctly computed. 

For instance, if a customer sends 1000.50 to a vendor, Blnk accepts the amount value as 1000.50 (`float`), retrieves the precision (e.g. 100) from the payload, and applies it to the amount. This converts our amount from 1000.50 to 100050 (the `precise_amount`).

<Tip>The lowest unit for an asset class is a value that has no decimal point regardless of what amount is passed.</Tip>

## Introducing rates

You can now record transactions between two different asset classes (`currency`). By passing the `rate` value, Blnk automatically applies the rate to the amount being sent and records it in the destination balance.

E.g., if a NGN balance is sending 1000 Naira to a USD balance, you can record the transaction with the `1NGN = 0.00081USD` rate like this:

```json request
{
	"reference": ref_1234567890
	"amount": 1000,
	"currency": "NGN",
	"precision": 100,
	"rate": 0.00081,
	"source": "bal_ngn",
	"destination": "bal_usd"
}
```

This will debit NGN 1000 from `bal_ngn` and credit USD 0.81 to `bal_usd`.

## Commit inflight transactions in bits

You can now commit transactions in `INFLIGHT` in bits, i.e., you can release the amount being held by your system in batches based on the conditions you've set for the transaction or participating balance. 

You can learn more in [Introducing Inflight](/ledger/tutorial/inflight).

## New & improved
1. Fixed typos in the payloads for `inflight` and `allow_overdraft`.
2. General bug and performance improvements.
