## Welcome to our first release

Blnk is now live and ready for you to try out in your applications.
	
In this version, you have all you need to set up a basic ledger for your applications. You can create a ledger, create balances, record transactions, schedule those transactions, and initiate a refund for a particular transaction where required.
	
We introduced [Balance Precision](/ledger/tutorial/precision) â€” a way to keep your ledger balances consistent and accurate in your ledger.

1. View a high level overview of every transaction activity happening in your financial application.
2. Organize the money movement workflows of your organization's internal account balances.	
3. Guarantee that you can trace and explain any anomaly in your ledger.
	
To get started, jump to the Blnk Ledger section in the side navigation bar.
