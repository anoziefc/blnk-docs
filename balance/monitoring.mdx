# What is a balance monitoring?

Balance monitoring is a crucial component in the fintech world. With transactions being processed every second, it's essential to ensure that balances remain accurate, updated, and within expected thresholds. BLNK offers an efficient way to monitor these balances in real-time, ensuring that financial operations run smoothly and anomalies are detected promptly.

## Why Monitor Balances?

In the fintech space, monitoring balances is vital for several reasons:

1. **Fraud Detection**: Unusual balance changes can be an early indication of fraudulent activities. Monitoring can trigger alerts for suspicious transactions, enabling timely intervention.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many financial regulations require institutions to maintain specific balance thresholds. Real-time monitoring ensures compliance with these regulations.
3. **Customer Notifications**: Customers can be notified in real-time if their account balance goes below a certain threshold, helping them manage their finances better.
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Instantly knowing when a balance reaches a certain threshold can trigger automatic actions, such as transferring funds between accounts or purchasing assets.


## Supported Fields
BLNK supports monitoring on the following fields:

- `balance`: The total balance.
- `credit_balance`: The total credit balance.
- `debit_balance`: The total debit balance.
