# What is a balance?

Balances are typically calculated for each ledger, and represent the total amount of that asset that is available for use or transfer. Balances are typically updated every time a new transaction is recorded in the ledger, and can be used to track the flow of assets between accounts and to ensure that the ledger remains in balance.

## A balance consist of three sub balances.

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Credit Balance | Credit balance holds the sum of all credit transactions recorded|
| Debit Balance | Debit balance holds the sum of all debit transactions recorded  |
| Balance | The actual Balance is calculated by summing the Credit Balance and Debit Balance|

# Computing Balances
Balances are calculated for very new transaction entry to a ledger.

A ledger can have multiple balances, depending on the types of accounts and assets that it tracks. For example, a ledger might have separate balances for different currencies.

## Example

### Sample Transaction Entries

| LedgerID | Currency | Amount | DRCR
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | USD| 100.00| CR
| 1 | USD| 50.00| CR
| 1 | NGN| 50,000.00| CR
| 1 | NGN| 1,000.00| CR
| 1 | GHS| 1,000.00| CR
| 1 | USD| 50.00| DR
| 1 | BTC| 1| DR


### Computed Balances

| LedgerID | BalanceID | Currency | Credit Balance | Debit Balance | Balance
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | 1 | USD  | 150.00 | 50.00 | 100.00
| 1 | 2 | NGN  | 51,000.00 | 0.00 | 51,000.00
| 1 | 3 | GHS  | 1,000.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00
