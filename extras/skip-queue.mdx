The `skip_queue` feature allows you to bypass the default transaction queuing system and process transactions directly to your balances. This is useful for scenarios where you need real-time transaction processing while still maintaining data consistency.

To enable this feature, include "skip_queue": true in the request body when calling the [Create Transaction](/reference/create-transaction.mdx) endpoint:

```json {6}
{
  "amount": 102.12,
  "precision": 100,
  ...
  "allow_overdraft": true,
  "skip_queue": true
}
```

### How it works

When you enable `skip_queue`, the transaction:

* Bypasses the normal queuing process
* Executes immediately on the balance
* Uses distributed locks via Redis to maintain consistency
* Applies optimistic locking at the database level

### When to use `skip_queue`

Use `skip_queue` for:

* Real-time payment processing in your ledger
* Interactive user sessions requiring immediate feedback
* Time-sensitive financial operations

Avoid using for: 

* Complex transactions with multiple steps or dependencies
* Transactions requiring external service validation
