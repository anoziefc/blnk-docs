title: 'Enable HTTPS for Blnk Server'
---

Deploying your Blnk server with HTTPS is crucial for protecting your data and ensuring the privacy and integrity of the information exchanged between your server and its clients. Blnk supports HTTPS out of the box, simplifying the process of securing your financial applications. This guide will walk you through setting up HTTPS for your Blnk server, assuming you have a basic understanding of Docker, Compose, and domain management.

<Info>
    **Prerequisite**
    - Docker 20.10.11 or later
    - Compose 1.29.2 or later
    - A valid domain name pointed to your server

## Enabling HTTPS in Blnk

Blnk simplifies the process of enabling HTTPS by automating the certificate management process. Follow these steps to secure your Blnk server:

### Step 1: Update Your Configuration

Modify your `blnk.json` configuration file to enable HTTPS. You only need to set the SSL flag to true and provide your domain and email for SSL certificate notifications:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "domain": "yourdomain.com",
    "ssl": true,
    "ssl_email": "your-email@example.com",
    "port": "5001"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Ensure Your Domain Points to Your Server

Before proceeding, ensure that the DNS settings for your domain are correctly configured to point to the IP address of your server. This step is crucial for the automated process to verify your domain and issue an SSL certificate.

### Step 3: Start Your Blnk Server

With your configuration file updated, start your Blnk server using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will initiate your Blnk server, including the automated process of obtaining an SSL certificate for your domain. The process involves validating your domain's ownership and issuing a certificate, which is then automatically configured for use by your Blnk server.

## Verifying HTTPS Setup

Once your server is running, you can verify the HTTPS setup by accessing your Blnk server through a web browser or using a tool like `curl`:

```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com:5001 -I
```

You should see a response indicating that the HTTPS connection is successful, along with other response headers.

## Next Steps

With HTTPS enabled, your Blnk server is now more secure, encrypting data in transit and providing a safer environment for your financial applications. Consider the following as you move forward:

- **Monitor and Renew Certificates**: While Blnk automates the initial certificate setup, ensure you monitor your domain and certificates for expiration and renew them as necessary.
- **Security Best Practices**: Continue to follow security best practices for your server, including keeping software up to date, managing access controls, and monitoring for unauthorized access.
