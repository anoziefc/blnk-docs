# What is a ledger?

Ledgers are a common feature of financial systems, and are used to record and track transactions and balances for a particular entity. In a system such as Blnk, ledgers might be used to track the financial transactions and balances of customers, as well as other financial entities such as banks, businesses, or governments.

To create a new ledger in a system like Blnk, you would typically need to specify an identity for the ledger. This identity could be the customer's name or account number, or the name or identification number of another financial entity. The identity of the ledger is used to uniquely identify the ledger within the system, and to associate it with the appropriate transactions and balances.

Once a ledger has been created, all transactions and balances for that ledger can be recorded and tracked within the system. This might include recording and updating the balances for various accounts or financial assets, as well as tracking the flow of assets between accounts. By maintaining accurate and up-to-date ledgers, it is possible to track the financial activity of a particular entity and to ensure the integrity and accuracy of financial transactions.
