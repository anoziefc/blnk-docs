The Blnk Ledger is a comprehensive database framework that lets you set up and record how money is stored and moved within your system.

Building financial applications requires foundational knowledge of digital money movement and storage to accurately keep and manage transaction records. As part of the package, many moving parts — banking and payment providers, eCommerce, settlement and reconciliation, etc. — also depend on how well your transactions are recorded.

It becomes crucial to you, as a developer, and your app to have a ledger that scales as your internal financial operations/capabilities scale. Because transaction records classify as very sensitive data, it is your responsibility to build and maintain an accurate, reliable, scaleable, and secure database that everything else in your application seamlessly connects to.

This is hard to do without deep industry (or financial accounting) experience. 

Hence, the Blnk Ledger.

### Why bother?

All financial applications require some kind of ledger. Why? Because these applications deal with transaction activities, and these activities have to be stored, tracked, and quantified in real-time. Whether it is banking, payments, lending, or embedded finance, at any given time, funds are either being sent, accepted or stored. 

How a financial application records these activities reflects their commitment to customer safety and security. Blnk uses 3 metrics to determine this commitment (and the Blnk Ledger was designed with them in mind):

1. **It is accurate:** All records must correctly reflect the right information per transaction to the smallest unit. This makes it very easy to perform settlements and reconciliation tasks on any account (internal or external).

2. **It can scale:** Whether it is a few hundred or millions of transactions per second, you can trust your ledger to manage the traffic excellently. As your application grows and becomes more capable to handle advanced financial operations, a great ledger scales alongside — offering you flexible control on your financial data.

3. **It is secure:** Financial data is sensitive data; a great ledger provides you with high level of security and protects the integrity of your data. Features like transaction immutability and balance monitoring provide you, the developer, with default security and more control over what's happening in your ledger.

### Ledger and balances

Blnk is designed using fundamental financial accounting principles. The most important one is **the Double Entry Accounting Principle**. It states that a debit entry in one account must be equal to a credit entry in another account to keep the accounts balanced. 

This means every transaction, ideally, must always have two records — one shows money out, the other shows money in.

>The source and destination of these transactions are referred to as **Balances.** This means that all transactions must have a defined source and destination. `Source` refers to the balance sending money out (or debit record) while `Destination` refers to the balance receiving money in (or credit record).

In the Blnk Ledger, **Balances** are like files that contain all the credit and debit transactions that's happened on a balance. In any application, these files are always growing — tens, hundreds, or thousands getting added every day depending on how you record your transactions. The more files you have, the higher the risk of chaos in your system.

To manage or remove this risk, you need a file manager. Traditional file managers allow you to use folders to group similar files together for easy navigation or reference. Blnk uses **Ledgers** as folders to manage and store your **Balances**.

>In simple terms, the Blnk Ledger is an easy-to-use file manager for storing transaction records in their respective **Balances** and grouping these balances in **Ledgers** for easy navigation or reference.

Ledgers are the folders; you click a ledger to see a list of all the balances grouped in it; and you click on a Balance to see the transaction records tied to the balance.](/images/blnk-ledger-overview.png)

### Getting started with the Blnk Ledger

The Blnk Ledger gives you full control and flexibility when building your application; however, you can only get maximum value from the Blnk Ledger if you critically think about your ledger architecture.

>**Ledger architecture** refers to how you want to structure your Blnk Ledger, i.e., what you want to track as balances and how you want to group these balances into ledgers.

This is crucial because with Blnk, everything begins with a ledger. Before you can record a transaction, you need to create a ledger, create a balance within the ledger, and then record a transaction within the balance.
