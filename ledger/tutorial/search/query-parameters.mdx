## Introduction

The query field, `q`, provides the query text you want to search for in your collection. It is required in all search request payloads that you send to search endpoint.

For instance, if you wanted to search for all transactions with a particular balance ID, you can input the `balance_id` value in the query field. The results will contain all transactions with that balance irrespective of whether it's the source or destination.

However, it's very useful to use the query field, `q`, with the `filter_by` field. This way, you can further streamline the results that you get when you execute a search query.

```json request
{
    "q": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "filter_by": "source:=bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0"
}
```

The sample request payload above will return ONLY transactions where the balance_id (`bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0`) was the source of the transaction. 

## Multiple query texts

You can provide more than one query text in the `q` field, e.g., `"q": "ngn fees inflight"` will return documents that contain at least one of these words in their results.

If you want to explicitly exclude a word in your query, you can prefix the word with the "â€“" operator, e.g. `"q": "ngn fees -inflight"` will return documents that contain `ngn` or `fees`, but exclude all documents that contain `inflight`.

## Return all

To return all documents in the collection without searching for a specific query text, you can use `*` as the query field's value.

```json request
{
    "q": *
}
```

This returns all documents in the collection specified in your endpoint URL. This is typically useful in conjunction with `filter_by`.
