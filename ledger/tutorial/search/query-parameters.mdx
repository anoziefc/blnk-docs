## Introduction

The query field, `q`, is used to query your ledger data. The query field is required in all search request payloads that you send to search endpoint.

It's always advised to use the query field, `q`, with the `filter_by` field. This way, you can further streamline the results that you get when you execute a search query.

```json request
{
    "q": "*",
    "filter_by": "source:=bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0"
}
```

The sample request payload above will return ONLY transactions where the balance_id (`bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0`) was the source of the transaction. 

## Return all

To return all documents in the collection without searching for a specific query text, you can use `*` as the query field's value.

```json request
{
    "q": "*"
}
```

This returns all documents in the collection specified in your endpoint URL. This is typically useful in conjunction with `filter_by`.
