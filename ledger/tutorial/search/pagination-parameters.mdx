## Overview

The `page` and `per_page` fields are used to manage pagination for your search results. 

Pagination is useful for handling large search results by allowing you break the data into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. This allows you fetch results faster and more efficiently.

`page` — Results from this specific page number will be fetched. Page numbers start at `1` for the first page. If not specified, the default value is `1`.

`per_page` — Number of records to fetch in one page. The default value for this field is `10` if it isn't specified. Note that only up to 250 records can be fetched per page.
