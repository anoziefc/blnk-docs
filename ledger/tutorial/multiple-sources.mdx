### Overview

Blnk provides a powerful tool that lets you process similar transactions from multiple sources to a single destination, providing your application with more customization and efficiency. 

This provides enhanced flexibility and control over complex money flows within your application. By consolidating multiple sources into one single transaction, you can monitor and manage transactions more effectively, contextualize your transaction, and facilitate easier tracking and reconciliation.

### How it works

Say a customer wants to receive NGN 30,000 from 3 people. Person A sends 10%, Person B sends NGN 20,000, and Person C sends the rest.

Here's a sample overview of their balance information:

| User | Balance ID | Expectation
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recipient | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38 | Will receive a total of NGN 30,000
| Person A | bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f | Will send 10% of NGN 30,000
| Person B | bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d | Will send NGN 20,000
| Person C | bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b | Will send the remaining amount left

<Steps>
	<Step title="Define your transaction parameters">
		Define the total amount to be sent, the source balances you are sending from, and the destination balance you are sending to.
		
		| Transaction parameters | Description
		| --- | ---
		| Amount| Total amount to be received by the recipient (NGN 30,000).
		|Sources| Balance IDs of all the balances the amount is sourced from.
		|Destination| Balance ID of the recipient.
		
		<Note>
			When sending from multiple sources, you can only send to one destination.
		</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Initiate the transaction">
		Call the [Record Transaction](/misc/record-transaction) endpoint and provide the following required fields.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "amount": 30000,
		    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
		    "currency": "NGN",
		    "sources": {
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f",
				    "distribution": "10%",
				    "narration": "Monthly contribution"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d",
				    "distribution": "20000",
				    "narration": "Monthly contribution"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b",
				    "distribution": "left",
				    "narration": "Monthly contribution"
			    }
		    },
		    "destination": "bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38"
		}
		```
		
		| Parameter | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		|`amount`| Total amount of money to be received. | Yes | `float`
		|`reference`| Unique transaction reference. | Yes | `string`
		| `currency`| Short code for your asset class. **See also → [Defining asset classes](/ledger/guide/asset-classes).** |Yes|`string`
		| `sources`| Contains information about the sources from where the money is being sent from. Each object within this array represents a source and has 2 required fields — `identifier` and `distribution`. | Yes
		|`identifier`| Sender's balance ID | Yes | `string`
		| `distribution`|Specific amount being drawn from the respective source. | Yes | `string`
		|`narration`| Short description of why the transaction is being initiated. | No | `string`
		| `destination`| Recipient's balance ID. | Yes | `string`
		
		<Note>When sending from multiple sources, you do not need to include the `source` parameter in your payload. Use the `sources` array to group the participating balances in your payload.</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Send your request">
		Once your request is received, Blnk automatically creates separate transaction records for each source with their respective amounts. This is crucial because Blnk runs on the [Double Entry Accounting Principle](/ledger/overview#ledger-and-balances).
		
		Blnk computes, queues and processes the transactions like this:
		
		| Reference | Currency | Amount | Source | Destination
		| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
		| ref_001adcfgf1 | NGN | 3000 | bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38
		| ref_001adcfgf2 | NGN | 20000 | bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38
		| ref_001adcfgf3 | NGN | 7000 | bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38
		
		At the end of the transaction, the recipient's balance will have a received a total of 30000.
		
		Transactions are queued by default waiting to be [applied](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction#transaction-statuses). We will notify you via the `transaction.applied` webhook once they are done.
	</Step>
</Steps>

### Distribution types

There are three ways you can specify how the amount should be distributed among the sources as you've seen in the example above.

| Distribution type | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific amount | Provide the specific amount of money to be sent | `"distribution": "20000"` - Means NGN 20,000 from the total amount should be sent
| Percentage | Calculates a percentage of the total amount to be sent | `"distribution": "10%"` - Means 10% of the total amount should be sent
| "left" | Calculates the remaining amount not assigned to a source | `"distribution": "left"` - Means the remaining amount left after others have been deducted should be sent

<Warning>When using the `left` distribution type, you can only use it in one instance per payload.</Warning>

It is crucial to ensure that the total sum of your `distribution` fields is exactly equal to the value specified in the `amount` field.

### Transaction references

Blnk auto-generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction record based on the original reference you provided in your transaction request. 

A counter, starting at `1`, is appended for each transaction record created ensuring that the individual transaction records have unique references derived from the original transaction reference. This makes sure that each transaction record is unique through its modified reference ensuring traceability and management while preserving the integrity of the original transaction's reference. 

<Tip>Refer to the sample transaction table in Step 3 above to see how it is applied.</Tip>

To track your transaction, call the [Get Transaction](/misc/get-transaction) endpoint and provide the transaction `id` or `reference` to track a specific transaction in your Blnk Ledger.
