description: Learn how to process transactions with multiple sources
---
### Overview

Blnk provides a powerful tool that lets you process similar transactions from multiple sources to a single destination, providing your application with more customization and efficiency. 

This enhances transaction transparency and traceability within your application by offering you and your end users enhanced control over financial operations. By consolidating multiple sources into one single transaction, you can monitor and manage transactions more effectively, contextualize your transaction, and facilitate easier tracking and reconciliation.

### How it works

Consider the following example.

You run an investment application, and you want to pay monthly interest from 3 portfolio accounts to your customer's account balance, `bal_001`.

| Portfolio Balance ID | Currency | Interest to be paid 
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------- 
| bal_pfl01            | NGN      | 20000               
| bal_pfl02            | NGN      | 30000              
| bal_pfl03            | NGN      | 50000              

<Steps>
	<Step title="Define your transaction parameters">
		Define the total amount to be sent, the source balances you are sending from, and the destination balance you are sending to.
		
		- **Amount**: 100000
		- **Sources:** `bal_pfl01`, `bal_pfl02`, `bal_pfl03`
		- **Destination:** `bal_001`
		
		<Note>
			When sending from multiple sources, you can only send to one destination.
		</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Initiate the transaction">
		Call the [Record Transaction](/misc/record-transaction) endpoint and provide the following required fields.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "amount": 100000,
		    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
		    "currency": "NGN",
		    "sources": {
			    {
				    "identifier": "@bal_pfl01",
				    "distribution": "20000"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "@bal_pfl02",
				    "distribution": "30000"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "@bal_pfl03",
				    "distribution": "50000"
			    }
		    },
		    "destination": "bal_001"
		}
		```
		
		- `amount`: Total amount of money being sent **(float).**
		- `reference`: Unique transaction reference **(string).**
		- `currency`: Short code for your asset class **(string)**. **See also → [Defining asset classes](/ledger/guide/asset-classes).**
		- `sources`: Contains information about the sources from where the money is being sent from. Each object within this array represents a source and includes two required fields:
			- `identifier`: Sender's balance ID **(string).**
			- `distribution`: Specific amount being drawn from the respective source **(string).**
		- `destination`: Recipient's balance ID **(string)**.
		
		<Note>When sending from multiple sources, you do not need to include the `source` parameter in your payload. Use the `sources` array to group the participating balances in your payload.</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Confirm your amount">
		Always make sure that the value of `amount` is equal to the sum of all values in the `distribution` fields.
		
		There are three ways you can fill in the `distribution` field.
		
		1. **Provide a specific amount:** Provide a specific amount that should be sent (`"distribution": "100000"`)
		2. **Use percentages:** When you provide a percentage (`"distribution": "50%"`), Blnk calculates it against the total amount to determine the exact amount to be sent.
		3. **Use `"left"`:** When you have defined the amount of money to be sent by other sources, use `"distribution": "left"` to instruct Blnk to send the remaining amount left from the last remaining source.
		   
		   <Warning>Please note that there cannot be two or more objects in the `sources` array with `"distribution": "left"`.</Warning>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Send your request">
		Once your request is received, Blnk automatically creates separate transaction records for each source with their respective amounts. This is crucial because Blnk runs on the [Double Entry Accounting Principle](/ledger/overview#ledger-and-balances).
		
		Blnk queues and processes the transactions like this:
		
		| Reference | Currency | Amount | Source | Destination
		| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
		| ref_001adcfgf01 | NGN | 20000 | bal_pfl01 | bal_001
		| ref_001adcfgf02 | NGN | 30000 | bal_pfl02 | bal_001
		| ref_001adcfgf03 | NGN | 50000 | bal_pfl03 | bal_001
		
		At the end of the transaction, the recipient's balance will have a received a total of 100000.
		
		Transactions are queued by default waiting to be [applied](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction#transaction-statuses). We will notify you via the `transaction.applied` webhook once they are done.
	</Step>
</Steps>

### Track your transaction

Blnk auto-generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction record based on the original reference you provided in your transaction request. 

A counter, starting at 1, is appended for each transaction record created ensuring that the individual transaction records have unique references derived from the original transaction reference. This makes sure that each transaction record is unique through its modified reference ensuring traceability and management while preserving the integrity of the original transaction's reference.

To track your transaction, call the [Get Transaction](/misc/get-transaction) endpoint and provide the transaction `id` or `reference` to track a specific transaction, or leave it blank to view all transactions in your Blnk Ledger.
