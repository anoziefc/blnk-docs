## Overview

Inflight, `inflight`, is a transaction parameter that instructs Blnk to hold on applying a transaction until a condition has been met. This condition could be confirming that it has been processed in real life by your payment partners or custom conditions set by your application. 

<Tip>
	Before you continue, learn more about transaction workflows → [Transaction workflows](../guide/transaction-workflows).
</Tip>

This is very useful for transactions that may take a while to complete. It also makes sure that funds are not available for a balance to spend until the transaction has actually happened, and you no longer have to always initiate a refund when your partners return a failed response.

## How Inflight transactions works

When you enable `inflight` on your transactions, the workflow becomes slightly different from the default way a transaction is recorded. 

In this section, you'll learn the step-by-step process of how Blnk works when you enable `inflight` on a transaction.

#### Before the conditions are met

When you record a new transaction, it's added to the transaction queue by default. Once it is ready for processing, the transaction status is updated to `INFLIGHT` and three new sub-balances are created within the balances specified in the source and destination fields.

- `inflight_credit_balance`: Total amount of money waiting to be credited.
- `inflight_debit_balance`: Total amount of money waiting to be debited.

While the transaction is in `INFLIGHT`, the amount is debited from the source's `inflight_debit_balance` and credited into the destination's `inflight_credit_balance`. The balances of the `source` and `destination` remain untouched.

![Step 1: How a transaction is processed in Inflight](/images/step-01-02-using-inflight.png)

Why inflight balances? The transaction has not been applied, so the balances of the `source` and `destination` cannot be affected yet. Inflight balances exist to help you keep track of the amounts yet to be debited or credited to a balance.

>When a transaction is `INFLIGHT`, it is advised to ensure that the source balance has enough funds to complete the transaction once it moves to the next change. We encourage to do balance checks and prevent the source balance from having a balance lower than the amount in its `inflight_debit_balance`.

In the example above, USD 50 is being sent. Because `inflight` is enabled, the amount was debited from the source's `inflight_debit_balance` instead of the `source` itself, and credited to the destination's `inflight_credit_balance` instead of the `destination` itself. 

#### After the conditions are met

Once the conditions are met, Blnk expects one of two instructions — commit or void.

- `Commit`: Instructs Blnk to continue with the transaction and apply it to the balances. This debits the `source` and credits the source's `inflight_debit_balance`; and debits the destination's `inflight_credit_balance` and credits the `destination`.
- `Void`: Instructs Blnk to stop and void the transaction. This refunds the transaction between both inflight balances, and nothing else needs to be done.

#### Calculating balances when Inflight is applied

When a transaction is inflight, the balances of the source and destination are not updated until you have committed the transaction. 

Blnk records the amount being held in inflight in Inflight balances. Each ledger balance is assigned an `inflight_credit_balance` and an `inflight_debit_balance`. 

It is important to make sure the amount being held in inflight is available in the ledger balance. If not, any commit instruction will be rejected. 

The best way to do this, within your application, is to prevent your user from having access to the amount being held in inflight. To do this:

- `balance` - Total balance of the ledger balance.
- `inflight_credit_balance` - Total amount waiting to be added to your balance.
- `inflight_debit_balance` - Total amount waiting to be deducted from your balance.
- `available_balance` - Total amount accessible by your user (`balance` - `inflight_debit_balance`). This is computed by you in your application

## Applying `inflight` to transactions

<Steps>
	<Step title="Initiate a transaction">
		Send a request to the [Record Transaction](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction) endpoint and input the required fields. Include `"inflight": true` to enable Inflight for the transaction.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "amount": 750000,
		    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
		    "currency": "USD",
		    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
		    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
		    "description": "For fees",
		    "inflight": true,
		    "inflight_expiry_date": "2024-02-03 12:38:19"
		}
		```
		
		>`expiry_date` defines when this transaction should expire if it hasn't be committed or voided yet.
		
		To disable Inflight, remove the `inflight` field from your request payload.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Transaction is added to queue for processing">
		The transaction is immediately [added to a queue](/ledger/guide/queuing-transactions) for processing with its status set to `QUEUED`. 
		
		Once it is ready to be processed, the status is updated to `INFLIGHT` and a `transaction.inflight` webhook event is sent to notify you. The transaction record is held in `INFLIGHT` until you instruct Blnk with the next steps.
		
		<Note>
			When a transaction is `INFLIGHT`, the amount is not applied to the participating balances.
		</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Instruct Blnk what to do next">
		Once the condition is met, call the [Inflight](/misc/update-inflight-transaction) endpoint URL. Provide the `id` of the transaction and instruct what you want Blnk to do with the transaction. 
		
		```json request
		{
			"id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
			"inflight_status": "commit"
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required? | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `id` | Unique ID of the transaction. | Yes | String
		|`inflight_status` | Instruction to Blnk depending on if the condition has been met. Send `commit` if you want Blnk to apply the transaction to the balances OR `void` if it should be discarded. | Yes | String
	</Step>
	<Step title="✅ — If asked to 'commit':">
		Blnk creates a new transaction record with the details of the `INFLIGHT` transaction and applies it to the balances. The source's `inflight_debit_balance` and destination's `inflight_credit_balance` are reset, and the money moves from the source to the destination.

		You can also choose to commit in bits, i.e., you can instruct Blnk to release the held funds in bits. To do this, pass an `amount` field in your inflight request payload like this:

		```json request
		{
			"status": "commit",
			"amount": 1000
		}
		```

		1. Make sure the amount being passed is less than or equal to the amount being held in `INFLIGHT`.
		2. You can commit as many as times as you want as long as the sum of the amounts of each commit is less than or equal to the amount being held in `INFLIGHT` for that particular transaction.
	</Step>
	<Step title="❌ — If asked to 'void':">
		If voided, Blnk also creates a new transaction record with the details of the `INFLIGHT` transaction. However, this time, the status will be `VOID`; it is not applied to any of the balances, and the source's `inflight_debit_balance` and destination's `inflight_credit_balance` are reset. 

		You cannot void in bits. 
	</Step>
</Steps>

#### Inflight statuses

There are three total inflight statuses you can send in the payload. Please note, an inflight status is different from a transaction status. An `inflight_status` field represents the instruction given to Blnk to apply to the transaction.

- `commit`: This means the inflight conditions have been met and the transaction should be applied to its balances.

- `void`: This means the inflight conditions were not met and the transaction should be discarded.

- `expired`: This means the transaction stayed in the `INFLIGHT` status past the specified expiry date. If an inflight transaction expires, a new transaction record is created with its status saved as `EXPIRED` and the transaction is discarded.

#### Use cases

Inflight is best used when a balance in your Blnk Ledger is the `source` and your application has little control over how the transaction actually happens in real life. This means transactions between balances in your Blnk Ledger do not need to have `inflight` enabled.

Useful applications for `inflight` include:

- **For managing KYC limits:** When an account crosses its KYC limits determined by your application, you can hold all deposits with inflight until the user's KYC is updated.
- **For escrow:** Inflight allows you to easily implement escrow features in your application, allowing your users see the amount being held (but not available to them to spend).
- **For card payouts:** Hold amounts in an inflight balance until the card is authorized by the payment processor for successful payment.  
- **For external payouts:** Hold amount in an inflight balance while your payout is being processed by your provider; only release it when the transaction is successful or failed.
