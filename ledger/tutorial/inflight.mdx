## Background

When you record transactions on Blnk, there are three main statuses — queued, applied, and rejected.

First, you have a default `QUEUED` status immediately your "record transaction" request is sent; then a final `APPLIED` status when it has been applied to the participating balances. 

>When a transaction has been applied to a balance, it means the transaction amount has reflected in the balances computed. For instance, if a balance received funds, `APPLIED` means the transaction amount has been added to its total balance.

![How transaction recording works represented by a NGN50 transaction from a source to a destination](/images/how-transaction-recording-works.png)

A transaction status is only updated to `REJECTED` if all of the conditions required for a transaction has not been met.

The conditions are:

1. The participating balances (`source` and `destination`) must have the same asset class (`currency`) as specified in the transaction request.
2. The `source` must have enough funds to process the transaction. 
3. Overdraft must be enabled if the transaction has to happen but the `source` has insufficient funds.

## Transaction recording workflows

It is crucial to make sure that your transaction records reflect exactly what's going on in the outside world, i.e., if you record that a certain balance has sent money to an account, it needs to have actually happened for the record to be true. 

To do this, you need to implement workflows that ensure your Blnk Ledger accurately mirrors what happens in real life.

There are two main ways to implement this workflow:

1. Payout workflow
2. Pay-in workflow

#### Payout workflow

You record the transaction first in your Blnk Ledger before it happens in real life. This workflow is best advised when recording transactions between balances in your Blnk Ledger or transactions to an external balance.

![A visual representation of how forward logging workflow works](/images/payout-workflow.png)

This is how to approach it:

1. When a transaction is initiated, [record it](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction) first in your Blnk Ledger. This makes sure that your ledger serves as the full source of truth for every transaction activity that goes in your application.

2. Blnk sends a `transaction.applied` webhook when the transactions has been applied to the balances. [Set up your application to listen for this webhook event](/intro/notifications). This also means all conditions for a successful transaction to take place have been met.

3. If it is a transaction between balances managed by your application, you don't have to do anything. 
   
4. If it is a transaction to an external balance, immediately trigger a payout with your payment partners as soon as you receive the `transaction.applied` webhook event.
	- If you receive a `successful` response from your partners, you are good to go; you don't have to do anything else. 
	- If you receive a `failed` response from your partners meaning they were unable to process it, you can [refund the transaction](/ledger/tutorial/refund-transactions) on your Blnk Ledger.

#### Pay-in workflow

Here, the transaction happens first in real life before you record it in your Blnk Ledger. 

![A visual representation of how reverse logging workflow works](/images/pay-in-workflow.png)

This is how to approach it:

1. When an external balance initiates a transaction with a balance managed by your application, your partners notify you via a webhook that you've received some funds. 

2. Once confirmed, identify which specific balance the transaction is intended for, and immediately initiate a transaction record on your Blnk Ledger providing the specified `balance_id` as the destination.

3. Blnk sends a `transaction.applied` webhook to notify you that the balance now reflects the transaction.

## What is Inflight?

Inflight, `inflight`, is a transaction parameter that instructs Blnk to hold on applying a transaction until a condition has been met. This condition could be confirming that it has been processed in real life by your payment partners or custom conditions set by your application.

This is very useful for transactions that may take a while to complete. It also makes sure that funds are not available for a balance to spend until the transaction has actually happened, and you no longer have to always initiate a refund when your partners return a failed response.

## How Inflight transactions works

When you enable `inflight` on your transactions, the workflow becomes slightly different from the default way a transaction is recorded. 

In this section, you'll learn the step-by-step process of how Blnk works when you enable `inflight` on a transaction.

#### Before the conditions are met

When you record a new transaction, it's added to the transaction queue by default. Once it is ready for processing, the transaction status is updated to `INFLIGHT` and two new sub-balances are created within the balances specified in the source and destination fields.

- `inflight_credit_balance`: Total amount of money waiting to be credited.
- `inflight_debit_balance`: Total amount of money waiting to be debited.

While the transaction is in `INFLIGHT`, the amount is debited from the source's `inflight_debit_balance` and credited into the destination's `inflight_credit_balance`. The balances of the `source` and `destination` remain untouched.

![Step 1: How a transaction is processed in Inflight](/images/step-01-02-using-inflight.png)

Why inflight balances? The transaction has not been applied, so the balances of the `source` and `destination` cannot be affected yet. Inflight balances exist to help you keep track of the amounts yet to be debited or credited to a balance.

In the example above, NGN 50 is being sent. Because `inflight` is enabled, the amount was debited from the source's `inflight_debit_balance` instead of the `source` itself, and credited to the destination's `inflight_credit_balance` instead of the `destination` itself. 

#### After the conditions are met

Once the conditions are met, Blnk expects one of two instructions — commit or void.

- `Commit`: Instructs Blnk to continue with the transaction and apply it to the balances. This debits the `source` and credits the source's `inflight_debit_balance`; and debits the destination's `inflight_credit_balance` and credits the `destination`.
- `Void`: Instructs Blnk to stop and reject the transaction. This refunds the transaction between both inflight balances, and nothing else needs to be done.

## Applying `inflight` to transactions

<Steps>
	<Step title="Initiate a transaction">
		Send a request to the [Record Transaction](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction) endpoint and input the required fields. Include `"inflight": true` to enable Inflight for the transaction.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "amount": 750000,
		    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
		    "currency": "NGN",
		    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
		    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
		    "description": "For fees",
		    "inflight": true
		}
		```
		
		To disable Inflight, remove the `inflight` field from your request payload.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Transaction is added to queue for processing">
		The transaction is immediately [added to a queue](/ledger/guide/queuing-transactions) for processing with its status set to `QUEUED`. 
		
		Once it is ready to be processed, the status is updated to `INFLIGHT` and a `transaction.inflight` webhook event is sent to notify you. The transaction record is held in `INFLIGHT` until you instruct Blnk with the next steps.
		
		<Note>
			When a transaction is `INFLIGHT`, the amount is not applied to the participating balances.
		</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Instruct Blnk what to do next">
		Once the condition is met, call the [Inflight](#) endpoint URL. Provide the `id` of the transaction and the real-life status of the transaction. 
		
		```json request
		{
			"id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
			"inflight_status": "commit",
			"expiry_date": "2024-02-03 12:38:19",
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required? | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `id` | Unique ID of the transaction. | Yes | String
		|`inflight_status` | Instruction to Blnk depending on if the condition has been met. `commit` means it was successful and the transaction should be applied in your ledger. `void` means it failed and the transaction should be rejected. | Yes | String
		| `expiry_date` | Defines when the inflight status should expire. If it expires, the transaction is automatically voided. | No | String  
		
		If successful, Blnk commits the transaction — the transaction status is updated to `APPLIED`, and a `transaction.applied` webhook event is sent to you.
		
		If failed, Blnk voids the transaction — the transaction status is updated to `REJECTED`, and a `transaction.rejected` webhook event is sent to you.
	</Step>
</Steps>

#### Use cases

Inflight is best used when a balance in your Blnk Ledger is the `source` and your application has little control over how the transaction actually happens in real life. This means transactions between balances in your Blnk Ledger do not need to have `inflight` enabled.

Useful applications for `inflight` include:

- Sending funds to an external balance (bank account or wallet).
- Making an online payment with a card.
- Making an in-person payment with a physical card.
