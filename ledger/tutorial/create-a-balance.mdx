### Overview
This guide shows you how to create and connect a balance to an existing ledger. A **Balance** represents the source or destination of a transaction record.

<Note>
	The Blnk Ledger is designed based on the **Double Entry Accounting Principle**; this means that all transactions must have a source (credit record) and a destination (debit record)
</Note>

Balances are always updated whenever a new transaction is recorded, and they can be used to track the flow of funds within your application ensuring that your books are always balanced.

Every **Balance** is made up of 3 sub-balances:

1. **Credit balance:** Total sum of all credits that's happened on a balance. 
2. **Debit balance:** Total sum of all debits that's happened on a balance.
3. **Total balance:** Calculated by subtraction the Debit balance from the Credit balance.

		This example shows how transactions are represented in the Blnk Ledger using `Source` and `Destination`.
		
		| Reference | Currency | Amount | Source | Destination 
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
		| ref_01 | NGN | 100.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| ref_02 | NGN | 500.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| **ref_03** | **NGN** | **300.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**
		| **ref_04** | **NGN** | **150.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**
		| ref_05 | NGN | 450.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| ref_06 | NGN | 200.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| **ref_07** | **NGN** | **200.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**

		Based on the sample transaction entries above, this is how a Balance with `"balance_id": "bal_01"` is computed within a ledger.
		
		| Ledger ID | Balance ID | Currency | Credit balance | Debit balance | Total balance

### Create a balance

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create a ledger">
		You cannot create a Balance without an existing ledger. If you do not have a ledger created yet, [click here to create one](/ledger/tutorial/create-a-ledger).
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create a balance">
		Call the [create-balance](/misc/create-balance) endpoint and provide the required fields.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
		    "currency": "NGN"
		}
		```
		
		- `ledger_id`: The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to **(required).**
		- `currency`: The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded **(required)**. 
		
		<Tip>
			Do not use one balance to record transactions for more than one currency. When recording transactions in a particular balance, The Blnk Ledger assumes all transactions in that balance are in the same currency. 
		</Tip>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Your balance gets created">
		Once your Balance has been created, you can move on to record your first transaction in your Blnk Ledger.
		
		```json response
		{
		    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
		    "balance": 0,
		    "credit_balance": 0,
		    "debit_balance": 0,
		    "currency": "NGN",
		    "precision": 1,
		    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
		    "identity_id": "",
		    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:33:01.311600208Z",
		    "meta_data": null
		}
		```
		
		- `balance_id`: The unique id of the balance you created **(string).**
		- `credit_balance`: Sum of all credit transaction amounts in the balance **(int64).**
		- `debit_balance`: Sum of all debit transaction amounts in the balance **(int64).**
		- `balance`: Sum of `credit_balance` and `debit_balance` **(int64).**
		- `precision`: Used to convert the amount to their smallest unit as defined by you **(int64).** See how it works → [Balance precision](ledger/tutorial/precision)
		- `identity_id`: The unique id of the user profile linked to the balance you created **(string).**
		- `created_at`: Date and time of creation **(string).**
		
		<Tip>
			Balances are always displayed as `int64`. Jump to [Balance Precision](/ledger/tutorial/precision) to learn more.
		</Tip>
	</Step>
</Steps>

### View your balance

You can request to see a list of all balances in your application, or the details of a particular balance.

To do this, call the [get-balance](/misc/get-balance) endpoint URL — `/balance/[balance_id]`.

- Provide the `balance_id` to see the details of a specific balance.
- Call the same URL without the `balance_id` to see a list of all the balances in your application.
