## Overview
This guide shows you how to create and connect a balance to an existing ledger. A **Balance** represents the source or destination of a transaction record.

<Note>
	The Blnk Ledger is designed based on the **Double Entry Accounting Principle**; this means that all transactions must have a source (credit record) and a destination (debit record)
</Note>

Balances are always updated whenever a new transaction is recorded, and they can be used to track the flow of funds within your application ensuring that your books are always balanced.

Every **Balance** is made up of 3 sub-balances:

1. **Credit balance:** Total sum of all credits that's happened on a balance. 
2. **Debit balance:** Total sum of all debits that's happened on a balance.
3. **Total balance:** Calculated by subtraction the Debit balance from the Credit balance.

		This example shows how transactions are represented in the Blnk Ledger using `Source` and `Destination`.
		
		| Reference | Currency | Amount | Source | Destination 
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
		| ref_01 | USD | 100.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| ref_02 | USD | 500.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| **ref_03** | **USD** | **300.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**
		| **ref_04** | **USD** | **150.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**
		| ref_05 | USD | 450.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| ref_06 | USD | 200.00 | bal_00 | bal_01
		| **ref_07** | **USD** | **200.00** | **bal_01** | **bal_00**

	<Accordion title="Sample Balance" icon="message-lines">
		Based on the sample transaction entries above, this is how a Balance with `"balance_id": "bal_01"` is computed within a ledger.
		
		| Ledger ID | Balance ID | Currency | Credit balance | Debit balance | Total balance

		| ldg_01 | bal_01 | USD | 1250.00 | 650.00 | 600.00

## Create a balance

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create a ledger">
		You cannot create a Balance without an existing ledger. If you do not have a ledger created yet, [click here to create one](/ledger/tutorial/create-a-ledger).
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create a balance">
		Call the [create-balance](/misc/create-balance) endpoint and provide the required fields.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
		    "currency": "USD"
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `ledger_id` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to | Yes | `string`
		| `currency` | The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded | Yes | `string`
		
		<Tip>
			Do not use one balance to record transactions with different `currency` values. When recording transactions in a particular balance, The Blnk Ledger assumes all transactions in that balance have the same `currency` value. 
		</Tip>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Your balance gets created">
		Once your Balance has been created, you can move on to record your first transaction in your Blnk Ledger.
		
		```json response
		{
		    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
			"balance": 0,
			"version": 0,
			"inflight_balance": 0,
			"credit_balance": 0,
			"inflight_credit_balance": 0,
			"debit_balance": 0,
			"inflight_debit_balance": 0,
			"precision": 0,
			"ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
			"identity_id": "",
			"indicator": "",
			"currency": "NGN",
			"created_at": "2024-02-20T05:33:01.311600208Z",
			"inflight_expires_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
			"meta_data": null
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `balance_id` | The unique id of the balance you created. | `string`
		| `balance` | Sum of `credit_balance` and `debit_balance`. | `int64`
		| `inflight_balance` | Sum of `inflight_credit_balance` and `inflight_debit_balance`. | `int64`
		| `credit_balance` | Sum of all credit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_credit_balance` | Total amount waiting to be added to your balance. | `int64`
		| `debit_balance` | Sum of all debit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_debit_balance` | Total amount waiting to be deducted from your balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_expires_at` | Date and time for inflight to expire. | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of creation. | `string`
		
	</Step>
</Steps>

## View your balance

To view the details of a particular balance in your Blnk Ledger, call the [Get Balance](/misc/get-balance) endpoint URL — `/balance/[balance_id]`. Provide the `balance_id` to fetch the details of a specific balance in real time.
