title: Search your Blnk data
description: Look up anything in your Blnk Ledger
---
### Overview

You can use "Search" to retrieve any data — ledgers, balances, and transactions — from your Blnk Ledger in a fully customizable manner. With "Search", you can efficiently display data in your application, easily track balances and transactions, filter specific information needed from your ledger for investigation, etc.

This guide contains everything you need to know about using "Search."

### Getting started

"Search" supports both `GET` and `POST` HTTP methods offering you flexibility in conducting searches based on the complexity of the query.

- Use `GET` for simple searches, sending parameters in the URL.
- Use `POST` for complex queries, sending parameters in the request body.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Call the 'Search' endpoint URL">
		Here is the endpoint: `/search/:collection`.
		
		`:collection` refers to the collection of data you want to search. There are 3 data collections in the Blnk Ledger:
		
		1. Ledgers (`/search/ledgers/`)
		2. Balances (`/search/balances/`)
		3. Transactions (`/search/transactions/`)
	</Step>
	<Step title="Input your search query">
		Replace the `:collection` placeholder with your search query. See `GET` and `POST` examples of a payload searching the balances data collection:
		
		```http GET
		GET https://api.blnkserver.xyz/search/transactions?q=NGN&filter=balance>1000&sort=-created_at&page=1&per_page=10
		```
		```json POST
		{
		  "q": "NGN",
		  "filter": "balance > 1000",
		  "sort": "-created_at",
		  "page": 1,
		  "per_page": 10
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required? | Type | Example
		| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `q` | The search query, looking for matches in your data | Yes | `string` | `q=NGN` searches for balances in "NGN"
		| `filter` | Narrows down the results based on specific conditions | No | `string` | `balance>1000` filters results to only include those with balances greater than 1000
		| `sort` | Specifies the order of the search results | No | `string` | `sort=-created_at` orders results by the `created_at` field in descending order.
		| `page` | Selects the page number of the search results | No | `int64` | `page=1` fetches the first page of the results.
		| `per_page` | Specifies the number of results per page | No | `int64` | `per_page=10` limits the number of results to 10 per page.
	</Step>
	<Step title="You're good to go!">
		Blnk processes your search query and the results are presented you in the following response format.
		
		```json response
		{
		  "found": 2,
		  "hits": [
		    {
			    "document":{
				    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
				    "balance": 3000,
				    "credit_balance": 5000,
				    "debit_balance": 2000,
				    "currency": "NGN",
				    "precision": 100,
				    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
				    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
				}
			},
			{
			    "document":{
				    "balance_id": "bln_06756vf-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f97fhg57",
				    "balance": 40000,
				    "credit_balance": 45000,
				    "debit_balance": 5000,
				    "currency": "NGN",
				    "precision": 100,
				    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
				    "created_at": "2024-01-13 13:30:03 UTC",
				}
			}
		  ]
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `found` | Indicates the total number of documents found | `int64`
		| `hits` | Contains an array of individual search results. Each object represents a document that matches the search query | `array`
		| `document` | Represents a single piece of data that matches the search query | `object`
		
		<Note>The fields inside the `document` object will match the same fields that make up the respective data collection you specified.</Note>
