### Overview

Everything in Blnk begins with a ledger and this guide shows you how to create and view a ledger in your Blnk server. 

### Before you start

Make sure you have read and understood how [the Blnk Ledger](/ledger/overview) works. If you are confused or have any questions, please [join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-1tr5864/shared_invite/zt-2d9oejhwl-6VJsXV7Vmy0mCX2vzBXnWA) and share your questions in a relevant channel.

### Create a ledger
<Steps>
	<Step title="Decide a name for the ledger">
		Send a request to the [create-ledger](/misc/create-ledger) endpoint with the following attributes:
		
		```json request
		{
		    "name": "Customer Wallets Ledger",
		    "meta_data": {
		        "project_owner": "Blnk Tech"
		    }
		}
		```
		
		- `name`: A name that best describes the function of the ledger **(required)**
	</Step>
	<Step title="Your ledger gets created">
		Once your ledger has been created, you can move on to create a balance connected to the ledger. 
		
		```json response
		{
		    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
		    "name": "Customer Wallets Ledger",
		    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:28:03.558281542Z"
		}
		```
		
		- `ledger_id`: Unique identification number for your ledger **(string).**
		- `name`: The name of your ledger **(string).**
		- `created_at`: Date and timestamp of when it was created **(string).**
	</Step>
</Steps>

### View your ledger

You can request to see a list of all ledgers in your system, or the details of a particular ledger.

To do this, call the [get-ledgers](/misc/get-ledger) endpoint URL â€” `/ledgers/[ledger_id]`.

- Provide the `ledger_id` to see the details of a specific ledger.
- Call the same URL without the `ledger_id` to see a list of all the ledgers in your system.
