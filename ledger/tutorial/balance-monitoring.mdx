## Overview

Balance monitoring lets you keep track of the balances in your Blnk Ledger. This is important in building financial applications, especially in cases where specific balances have defined thresholds.

You can monitor all 3 sub-balances of a balance — credit balance (`credit_balance`), debit balance (`debit_balance`) and total balance (`balance`). 

**See also → [Create a balance](/ledger/tutorial/create-a-balance).**

## Why monitor balances?

1. **Fraud detection:** Unusual balance changes can be an early indication of fraudulent activities. Monitoring can trigger alerts for suspicious transactions and ensure timely intervention.

2. **Regulatory compliance:** Many financial regulations require institutions to maintain specific balance threshold. Real-time balance monitoring makes it easy to comply with these regulations.

3. **Customer notifications:** Customers can be notified in real-time if their balance crosses a specific threshold. It can also be used for segmenting your customers in your application.

4. **Operational efficiency:** Instantly knowing when a balance reaches a certain threshold can trigger automatic actions, such as transferring funds between accounts or purchasing assets.

## Set up balance monitoring

<Steps>
	<Step title="Determine and set your conditions">
		
		Select what should be monitored on a particular balance, e.g., notify me when the `debit_balance` is above 100000.
		
		Call the [Create Balance Monitor](/misc/create-balance-monitor) endpoint and provide the following fields in the request payload:
		
		```json request
		{
		    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
		    "condition": {
		        "field": "debit_balance",
		        "operator": ">",
		        "value": 100000
		    },
		    "description": "Tier 1 Account"
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required? | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `balance_id` | Unique identifier of the balance to be monitored. | Yes | `string`
		| `condition` | Object representing the condition to be satisfied. | Yes
		| `field` | Specific sub-balance to monitor. It can be `debit_balance`, `credit_balance`, or `balance`. | Yes | `string`
		| `operator` |  Indicates the comparison operation to be performed between the field and operator. **See below → [Supported operators](#supported-operators).** | Yes | `string`
		| `value` | The value against which the `field` is compared. | Yes | `int64`
		| `description` | Description of your balance monitor. It is left empty if it's not passed in the request. | No | `string`
		
		In this example, Blnk is asked to monitor the balance and send a notification when its `debit_balance` is greater than 100000.
	</Step>
	<Step title="You're good to go!">
		Blnk stores your monitoring request with a unique `monitor_id`. Once the condition is met, you will get instantly notified via the `balance.monitor` webhook event. 
		
		**See also → [Setting up notifications](/ledger/guide/notifications).**
		
		```json response
		{
		    "monitor_id": "mon_e0e77b0c-4985-472a-9bf5-76a48b0259b0",
		    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
		    "condition": {
		        "field": "debit_balance",
		        "operator": ">",
		        "value": 1000000
		    },
		    "description": "Tier 1 Account",
		    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:56:58.257315054Z"
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `monitor_id` | Unique identifier for your balance monitor. | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of creation. | `string` 
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Supported operators

This is a list of all supported operators by the Balance monitor:

|Operators|Symbol|Description
|------|------|------|
|Greater than|>|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is greater than `value`
|Less than|&lt;|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is less than `value`
|Equal to|=|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is exactly equal to `value`
|Not equal to|!=| Checks if the specified balance in `field` is not equal to `value`
|Greater than or equal to|>=|Check if the specified balance in `field` is greater than or equal to `value`
|Less than or equal to|&lt;=|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is less than or equal to `value`

## View balance monitor

You can request to see a list of all balance monitors in your application, or the details of a particular monitor.

To do this, call the [Get Balance Monitor](/misc/get-balance-monitor) endpoint URL with the/

- Provide the `monitor_id` in the URL to see the details of a specific balance monitor.
- Call the same URL without the `monitor_id` to see a list of all the balance monitors in your application.

**See also → [Search your Blnk data](/ledger/tutorial/search/overview).**

## Update balance monitor

To update the conditions of a particular balance monitor, call the [Update balance montior](/misc/update-balance-monitor) endpoint using the `monitor_id` and pass the updated conditions.
