# Introduction to General Ledgers in Blnk

In the financial world, general ledgers serve as the backbone of any accounting system. They provide a comprehensive record of all financial transactions within an organization, ensuring accuracy and integrity in financial reporting. Blnk leverages the concept of general ledgers to offer a robust framework for tracking the movement of money across your business or organization. This document will guide you through creating, naming, and posting transactions to the general ledger.


## Naming Conventions for General Ledgers

When naming your general ledger's balances, it's crucial to adopt a consistent and descriptive naming scheme. This ensures ease of identification and reduces the risk of errors during transaction postings. Blnk recommends using the "@" symbol as a prefix for all general ledger balances. Here are some tips for naming your general ledger balances:

- **Be Descriptive**: Choose names that clearly describe the balance's purpose, such as `@OperatingExpenses` or `@Revenue`.
- **Use CamelCase or underscores**: For better readability, use CamelCase (e.g., `@RevenueFromSales`) or underscores (e.g., `@revenue_from_sales`) to separate words.
- **Avoid Spaces**: Do not use spaces in balance names to prevent formatting issues. Use CamelCase or underscores instead.
- **Keep it Short**: While being descriptive, try to keep the name reasonably short to facilitate easier referencing.

## Common General Ledgers
Below is a table of commonly used general ledgers in banks, fintech, and commerce organizations. This list can help you identify which ledgers might be relevant to your operations.

| Ledger Name        | Description                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `@Revenue`         | Tracks all income received by the business. |
| `@Expenses`        | Records all outgoings or expenses.        |
| `@Assets`          | Keeps track of the company's assets.      |
| `@Liabilities`     | Records the company's liabilities.        |
| `@Equity`          | Tracks the owner's equity in the business.|
| `@Receivables`     | Monitors amounts due from customers.      |
| `@Payables`        | Keeps track of what the company owes to suppliers. |
| `@Cash`            | Manages cash transactions.                |
| `@Fees`            | Records various fees, such as transaction fees. |

## Posting Transactions to or from a General Ledger
Blnk simplifies the financial management process by automating the creation and identification of general ledger balances. When a transaction is posted and a balance is referenced using the "@" prefix, Blnk checks for its existence within the general ledger. If the specified balance does not exist, it is automatically created, and the transaction is processed accordingly.

```json
{
    "amount": 750000,
    "reference": "QuarterlySubscriptionFee",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "@SubscriptionIncome",
    "destination": "@OperationalExpenses"
}
```
In this example, a transaction is made from the `@SubscriptionIncome` ledger to the `@OperationalExpenses` balance. If either ledger does not previously exist, Blnk will automatically create them, ensuring the transaction is accurately recorded without manual ledger setup.
