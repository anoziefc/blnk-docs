## Overview

Blnk provides a powerful tool that lets you process similar transactions from a single source to multiple destinations, providing your application with more customization and efficiency.

</Frame>

This provides enhanced flexibility and control over complex money flows within your application. By consolidating multiple sources into one single transaction, you can monitor and manage transactions more effectively, contextualize your transaction, and facilitate easier tracking and reconciliation.

## How it works

Say a customer wants to sends USD 30,000 from their account balance to three people. They want 20% to go to Person A, USD 10,000 to go to Person B, and the remaining amount to Person C. 

Here's a sample overview of their balance information:

| User | Balance ID | Expectation
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sender | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38 | Will send a total of USD 30,000
| Person A | bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f | Will receive 20% of USD 30,000
| Person B | bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d | Will receive USD 10,000
| Person C | bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b | Will receive the remaining amount left

<Steps>
	<Step title="Define your transaction parameters">
		Define the total amount to be sent, the source balance you are sending from, and the destination balances you are sending to.
		
		| Parameters | Description
		| --- | ---
		| Amount| Total amount to be sent by the sender (USD 30,000),
		|Source| Balance ID of the sender.
		|Destinations| Balance IDs of all the balances the amount is distributed to.
		
		<Note>
			When sending to multiple destinations, you can only send from one source.
		</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Initiate the transaction">
		Call the [Record Transaction](/misc/record-transaction) endpoint and provide the following required fields.
		
		```json request
		{
		    "amount": 30000,
		    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
		    "currency": "USD",
		    "source": "bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38"
		    "destinations": [
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f",
				    "distribution": "20%",
				    "narration": "For groceries"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d",
				    "distribution": "10000",
				    "narration": "For electricity bills"
			    },
			    {
				    "identifier": "bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b",
				    "distribution": "left",
				    "narration": "For savings"
			    }
		    ]
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		|`amount`| Total amount of money to be sent. | Yes | `float`
		|`reference`| Unique transaction reference. | Yes | `string`
		| `currency`| Short code for your asset class. **See also → [Defining asset classes](/ledger/guide/asset-classes).** |Yes|`string`
		| `source`| Sender's balance ID. | Yes | `string`
		| `destinations`| Contains information about the destinations the money is being sent to. Each object within this array represents a destination and has 2 required fields — `identifier` and `distribution`. | Yes
		|`identifier`| Destination's balance ID | Yes | `string`
		| `distribution`|Specific amount being sent to the respective destination. | Yes | `string`
		|`narration`| Short description of why the transaction is being initiated. | No | `string`
		
		<Note>When sending to multiple destinations, you do not need to include the `destination` field in your payload. Use the `destinations` array to group the participating balances in your payload.</Note>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Send your request">
		Once your request is received, Blnk automatically creates separate transaction records for each destination with their respective amounts. This is crucial because Blnk runs on the [Double Entry Accounting Principle](/ledger/overview#ledger-and-balances).
		
		Blnk computes, queues and processes the transactions like this:
		
		| Field | Currency | Amount | Source | Destination
		| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
		| ref_001adcfgf1 | USD | 6000 | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38 | bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f
		| ref_001adcfgf2 | USD | 10000 | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38 | bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d
		| ref_001adcfgf3 | USD | 14000 | bln_92e4b9b6-0b85-4ef4-87a2-682c31500d38 | bln_7d98dfe9-5c3e-4c9b-b96a-65f6d9f7b89b
		
		At the end of the transaction, the sender's balance will have sent a total of 30000.
		
		Transactions are queued by default waiting to be [applied](/ledger/tutorial/record-a-transaction#transaction-statuses). We will notify you via the `transaction.applied` webhook once they are done.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Distribution types

There are three ways you can specify how the amount should be distributed among the sources as you've seen in the example above.

| Distribution type | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific amount | Provide the specific amount of money to be received | `"distribution": "10000"` - Means USD 10,000 from the total amount should be received
| Percentage | Calculates a percentage of the total amount to be received | `"distribution": "20%"` - Means 20% of the total amount should be received
| "left" | Calculates the remaining amount not assigned to a destination | `"distribution": "left"` - Means the remaining amount left after others have been deducted should be received

<Warning>When using the `left` distribution type, you can only use it in one instance per payload.</Warning>

It is crucial to ensure that the total sum of your `distribution` fields is exactly equal to the value specified in the `amount` field.

## Transaction references

Blnk auto-generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction record based on the original reference you provided in your transaction request. 

A counter, starting at `1`, is appended for each transaction record created ensuring that the individual transaction records have unique references derived from the original transaction reference. This makes sure that each transaction record is unique through its modified reference ensuring traceability and management while preserving the integrity of the original transaction's reference. 

<Tip>Refer to the sample transaction table in Step 3 above to see how it is applied.</Tip>

To track your transaction, call the [Get Transaction](/misc/get-transaction) endpoint and provide the transaction `id` or `reference` to track a specific transaction in your Blnk Ledger.
