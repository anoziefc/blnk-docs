Blnk allows you to be able to schedule when you want a transaction to occur. 

This can be useful for use cases where your application has transactions that need to automatically happen on a certain date in the future.

<Note>
	All dates and times in Blnk are stored in the UTC timezone.

## Schedule a transaction

To schedule a transaction, use the [Record Transaction](/misc/record-transaction) endpoint and include the `scheduled_for` field in your request payload using the template in the example below:

```json record transaction
{
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@fees",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-02-20 05:28:03",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

```json response
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "destination": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "reference": "ref",
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "precise_amount": 10000000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-10-08T19:48:00",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

You're good to go. Blnk accepts and adds the transaction to its queue. Once the scheduled time is reached, the transaction gets applied, and we send you a notification via the `transaction.applied` webhook event.
