Blnk lets you easily process a transaction refund if you need to.

Refunds in Blnk only happen on transactions with the `APPLIED` status. This means the transactions have been permanently recorded, and the participating balances have been updated with the amount of the transaction.

When you ask Blnk to refund a transaction, it automatically creates a new transaction record and switches the `source` and `destination` balances of the original transaction — debiting the amount from the balance that initially received it and crediting it to the balance that initially sent it.

## Refund a transaction

To refund a transaction, use the [Refund Transaction](/misc/refund-transaction) endpoint and pass the `id` of the transaction that you want to refund. 

```curl request
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/refund-transaction/{id}
```

## Track a refund

After you initiate a refund, Blnk creates a new transaction record with its own unique transaction `id` and `reference`. You can use the [Get Transaction endpoint](/misc/get-transaction) to track the status of the refund. 

Once the status is `APPLIED`, it means the refund has been completed. We also notify you through the `transaction.applied` webhook event.
