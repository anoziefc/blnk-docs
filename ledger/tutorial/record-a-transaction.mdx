### Overview

This guide shows you how to post or record a transaction into your Blnk Ledger. It is best practice to ensure precise bookkeeping of all transaction activity happening in your app or software. 

There are 3 main ways a transaction can be categorized:

1. Money is received from an external source (accounts, cards, crypto, etc.)
2. Money is sent out to an external source (accounts, wallets, etc.)
3. Money is sent between balances in your application.

<Tip>
	An external source refers to a source or destination that isn't owned by your application. This includes other bank accounts, card payment providers, payout providers, etc.
</Tip>

To successfully post or record a transaction, the following attributes are required:

- `amount`: The transaction amount **(float).**
- `reference`: A unique string for referencing the transaction later **(string).** 
- `currency`: Short code for your asset class. It can be currency, crypto or custom to your app or software **(string)**.
- `source`: Balance ID of the sending balance **(string)**.
- `destination`: Balance ID of the receiving balance **(string)**.

>There are multiple ways to manage `Source` and `Destination` for transactions that involve an external source.
>
>However, it is best to create a dedicated balance, `@World`, to represent external sources, i.e., when receiving money from an external source, it is `"source": "@World"` and when sending money to an external source, it is "`destination: "@World"`. 
>
>Go to [Internal ledgers](/ledger/guide/internal-ledgers) for more information on how to use and manage `@World`.


### How Blnk records transactions

Blnk cares about the accuracy, security and integrity of your transaction data. As a result, all transaction records have 2 main properties â€” immutability and idempotency.

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Immutability" icon="shield-halved">
		All transactions in Blnk are immutable.
		
		Once they have been recorded, they cannot be altered or tampered with. This ensures the accuracy and unchangeability of the transaction record, even if the transaction is modified or reversed later.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Idempotency" icon ="code">
		All transactions in Blnk are idempotent.
		
		This ensures that performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as doing it once. This property is crucial for maintaining consistent outcomes across repeated transaction, especially in scenarios where network errors or other issues might cause transaction failures.
		
		E.g., a transaction moving funds from one `balance_id` to another, if idempotent, will result in the same balance regardless of how many times the transaction is executed. This prevents unintended consequences like multiple transfers or incorrect balances.
		
		Blnk ensures idempotency through the use of a unique `reference` for every transaction. This is why it is required for you to provide it when recording a transaction. It prevents Blnk from storing two transactions with the same reference and ensures consistent outcomes regardless of transaction repetition.

### Record a transaction

Send a request to the [record-transaction](/misc/record-transaction) endpoint and input the required attribute values.

```json request
{
    "amount": 750000,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746"
}
```

```json response
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "amount": 10000000,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "description": "",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-02-28T20:31:01.776677+01:00",
    "scheduled_for": "",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0,
    "risk_score": 0
}
```

That's all. You're good to go.
