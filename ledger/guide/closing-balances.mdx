## Overview

Closing a ledger balance means to calculate the net balance of a balance, and credit or debit the resulting amount, to zero the balance and move it to another ledger balance.

You can find the net balance of a ledger balance by viewing the `balance` field in its record. If it is negative, it needs a credit to zero the balance, and if it is positive, it needs a debit to zero the balance.

<Note>
    You cannot delete a balance created in your ledger. You can only prevent it from participating in any more transactions after its balance has been zeroed.
</Note>

## Example

Consider the following balances:

| Ledger balance | `currency` | `balance` | `credit_balance` | `debit_balance`
| --- | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
| A | USD | 400 | 500 | 100
| B | USD | -300 | 600 | 900

To close the ledger balances above:

| Ledger balance | `currency` | Amount received | Amount deducted
| --- | :---: | ---: | ---:
| A | USD | 0 | 400
| B | USD | 300 | 0

This will close out the ledger balances and you can prevent them from participating in any subsequent transactions.
