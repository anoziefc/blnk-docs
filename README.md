## Open-source fintech ledger for the internet

Blnk Ledger is a developer-first toolkit for building compliant financial products at scale. It is designed to help developers do three things well:

1. Accurately record transactions in their system.
2. Correctly manage complex flow of funds and transaction data.
3. Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.
