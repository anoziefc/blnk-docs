## Open-source fintech ledger for the internet

Blnk Ledger is an open-source fintech database for building fintech products to standard and at scale. We designed Blnk to help developers do three things well:

1. Accurately record transactions in their system.
2. Correctly manage complex flow of funds and transaction data.
3. Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.
