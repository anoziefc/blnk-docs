title: 'Overdraft Transactions'

Blnk introduces a flexible solution for managing transactions that exceed the available balance in your account. By enabling the overdraft feature, transactions can be processed even when the source balance does not cover the transaction amount. This guide explains how to use the `allow_over_draft` parameter in your transaction payload to permit an overdraft.

## Enable Overdraft on a Transaction
To allow a transaction to go into overdraft, simply include the `allow_over_draft` parameter set to `true` in your transaction request. Here's an example of how to structure your transaction payload:

```json record transaction
{
    "amount": 100,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@fees",
    "allow_over_draft": true
}
```

Upon setting `allow_over_draft` to true, Blnk will process the transaction even if the source account does not have sufficient funds, effectively allowing the account balance to go negative.
