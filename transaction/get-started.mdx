### Source and Destination

Transactions follow a `source` and `destination` structure, which simplifies the tracking of funds movement across accounts or ledgers. This approach provides a clear path of where funds are coming from and where they are headed, ensuring transparency and ease of tracking for all transactions.


<Info>
    Blnk recommends using general ledgers for transactions not tied to specific user or application balances, like the `@world` ledger for external money movements. This approach streamlines transaction handling and improves clarity.

| source       | The source balance from where the funds are drawn                                    | string |
| destination  | The destination balance where the funds are sent                                     | string |
| currency     | Transaction currency                                                                 | string |
| status       | The status of the transaction. Example: `APPLIED`, `QUEUED`, `SCHEDULED`             | string |
| reference    | Unique Transaction reference                                                         | string |
| description  | Transaction description                                                              | string |
| meta_data    | Custom metadata                                                                      | object |

### Immutability
Transactions are immutable, meaning once they have been recorded, their records cannot be altered or tampered with. This ensures the accuracy and unchangeability of the transaction record, even if the transaction is modified or reversed later.

### Idempotency
Transactions are idempotent, ensuring that performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as doing it once. This property is crucial for maintaining consistent outcomes across repeated transactions, especially in scenarios where network errors or other issues might cause transaction failures.

**For example**, a transaction transferring money from one account to another, if idempotent, will result in the same account balance regardless of how many times the transaction is executed. This prevents unintended consequences like multiple transfers or incorrect account balances.

Blnk ensures idempotency through the use of a unique `reference` for every transaction. This prevents storing two transactions with the same reference, ensuring consistent outcomes regardless of transaction repetition.
