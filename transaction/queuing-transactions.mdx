---

Queuing is a cornerstone of transaction management in Blnk, playing a crucial role in enhancing performance and maintaining synchronization across transactions. This approach ensures that transactions affecting a single balance are executed sequentially, preserving data integrity and minimizing conflict risks. This document delves into the intricacies of Blnk's queuing system and its pivotal role in streamlining transaction processing.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Partitioning for Similar Transactions**
Blnk implements a partitioning strategy that groups similar transactions for the same balance. This method ensures sequential processing of related transactions, enhancing data consistency and minimizing potential conflicts, thereby optimizing the transaction flow.

### 2. **Idempotency in Queued Transactions**
The idempotent design of transactions in Blnk works hand in hand with queuing. This combination ensures consistent outcomes for repeated transactions, a critical feature for resolving issues related to network errors or other disruptions that might cause transaction retries.

## Architectural Insights

Blnk's architecture integrates queuing seamlessly, as depicted in the following diagram:

This structure is designed to facilitate efficient and reliable transaction processing, ensuring that each transaction is accurately tracked and managed.



### Example Transactions

- **Transaction to a User Balance from Cash:**

```json
{
    "amount": 750000,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "@cash",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746"
}
```

- **Transaction Between User Balances:**

```json
{
    "amount": 750000,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746"
}
```

- **Fee Deduction Transaction:**

```json
{
    "amount": 100,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@fees"
}
```

- **Transaction Queued Response:**

```json response
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "destination": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "reference": "ref",
    "amount": 10000000,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "description": "",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-02-28T20:31:01.776677+01:00",
    "scheduled_for": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0,
    "risk_score": 0
}
```
