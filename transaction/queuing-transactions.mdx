title: 'Queuing Transactions'
description: ''
---

Queuing plays a vital role in managing and optimizing transactions within Blnk. It enhances performance and ensures synchronization, allowing only one transaction to act on a balance at any given time. This section provides key insights into how Blnk leverages queues for efficient transaction processing.


## Things to Notes

1. **Partitioning for Similar Transactions**: Blnk employs a partitioning strategy where similar transactions belonging to the same balance are grouped together. This ensures that related transactions are processed sequentially, maintaining data consistency and reducing the likelihood of conflicts.

2. **Idempotency and Queue Transactions**: The idempotent nature of transactions, as discussed earlier, complements queue support seamlessly. By combining idempotency with queues, Blnk guarantees that even if a transaction is repeated, the outcome remains consistent. This is crucial in scenarios where network errors or other issues may cause a transaction to be reattempted.

## Architecture Overview

To provide a visual representation of how queue support fits into the Blnk architecture, refer to the diagram below:

## Queue/Record Credit Transaction
```json record transaction
{
    "amount": 200,
    "description": "for cake",
    "reference": "ref-12343",
    "drcr": "Credit",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0
}
```

```json response
{
    "id": "txn_844c23ef-6cca-45b6-9878-0189e02334f7",
    "reference": "ref-12343",
    "amount": 200,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "description": "for cake",
    "drcr": "Cebit",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "credit_balance_before": 0,
    "debit_balance_before": 0,
    "credit_balance_after": 200,
    "debit_balance_after": 0,
    "balance_before": 0,
    "balance_after": 200,
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:37:35.535621126Z",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0,
    "risk_score": 0.0009
}
```

## Queue/Record Debit Transaction
```json record transaction
{
    "amount": 100,
    "description": "for cake",
    "reference": "ref-12344",
    "drcr": "Debit",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0
}
```

```json response from external service
{
    "id": "txn_844c23ef-6cca-45b6-9878-0189e02334g9",
    "reference": "ref-12344",
    "amount": 100,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "description": "for cake",
    "drcr": "Debit",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "credit_balance_before": 200,
    "debit_balance_before": 0,
    "credit_balance_after": 200,
    "debit_balance_after": 100,
    "balance_before": 200,
    "balance_after": 100,
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:37:35.535621126Z",
    "risk_tolerance_threshold": 0,
    "risk_score": 0.0029
}
```
