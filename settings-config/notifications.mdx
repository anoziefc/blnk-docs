description: Learn how to configure and manage notifications for transaction events in Blnk.
---

Blnk's notification system is designed to keep you informed about crucial transaction events in real-time. This documentation covers how Blnk leverages webhook notifications to alert you about transaction statuses such as queued and applied, as well as how to handle error events through Slack notifications. Follow this guide to configure notifications in your Blnk environment effectively.

## Notification Events

Blnk sends webhook notifications for two main transaction events:

1. **Transaction Queued**: This event is triggered when a transaction is successfully queued in the system. It indicates that the transaction is awaiting processing.
2. **Transaction Applied**: This event occurs when a transaction has been processed and applied to the balance. It signifies the completion of the transaction's lifecycle.

Each notification payload consists of two fields:

- **event**: Indicates the type of event (`transaction.queued` or `transaction.applied`).
- **data**: Contains the transaction payload, detailing the transaction information.

## Error Notifications

In addition to transaction events, Blnk provides the capability to send error notifications to a specified Slack webhook. This feature is particularly useful for monitoring and quickly addressing issues that may arise during transaction processing.

## Configuring Notifications

Notifications in Blnk can be configured through the `blnk.json` configuration file. This file allows you to specify your preferences for receiving webhook notifications and Slack error notifications. Below is an example configuration that demonstrates how to set up both notification types:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "url": "http://server:5001/webhooks",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_auth_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Slack Configuration

- **webhook_url**: The full URL of your Slack webhook. This URL is used by Blnk to send error notifications directly to your Slack channel.

### Webhook Configuration

- **url**: The endpoint URL where Blnk will send transaction event notifications.
- **headers**: Optional headers that you may need to include in the notification request. This can include authentication tokens or content type specifications.
