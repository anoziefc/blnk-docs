This guide demonstrates how to implement a secure and efficient cryptocurrency order exchange system with the Blnk Ledger. You'll learn how to handle order creation, escrow management, order matching, and atomic settlements.

A cryptocurrency exchange operates in three main phases:

* Order Creation: Users express their intent to trade by creating orders
* Order Matching: Compatible orders are paired together
* Settlement: Assets are exchanged atomically between parties

To illustrate this flow, let's work with a practical example where two users want to exchange different cryptocurrencies:

```
Initial State:
John has 1 ETH available in his account
Emily has 10 MATIC available in her account

Order Intent:
John wants to receive 10 MATIC in exchange for 1 ETH
Emily wants to receive 1 ETH in exchange for 10 MATIC
```

## Setting up your ledger

<Note>If you haven't, please [install Blnk](/home/install) to try this example out yourself.</Note>

Before implementing the exchange logic, we need to establish the foundational structure in your Blnk Ledger. Let's set up separate ledgers for each cryptocurrency and create the necessary balances:

1. Create two ledgers to segregate different cryptocurrencies:
    ```javascript
    const ethLedger = await Ledgers.create({
      name: "Customer ETH Ledger"
    });

    const maticLedger = await Ledgers.create({
      name: "Customer MATIC Ledger"
    });
    ```

2. Create balances for both users in each ledger:
    ```javascript
    // Create ETH balances
    const johnEthBalance = await Balances.create({
      ledger_id: ethLedger.id,
      currency: "ETH"
    });

    const emilyEthBalance = await Balances.create({
      ledger_id: ethLedger.id,
      currency: "ETH"
    });

    // Create MATIC balances
    const johnMaticBalance = await Balances.create({
      ledger_id: maticLedger.id,
      currency: "MATIC"
    });

    const emilyMaticBalance = await Balances.create({
      ledger_id: maticLedger.id,
      currency: "MATIC"
    });
    ```

3. Fund the initial balances:
    <Note>In this example, we'll use a precision of 100 to keep things simple. However, in real-world applications, cryptocurrency precision values can reach as high as 10^18, allowing for transactions to be measured in their smallest possible units.</Note>
    ```javascript
    // Fund John's ETH balance
    await Transactions.create({
      amount: 1, 
      currency: "ETH",
      reference: `ref_${uuidv4()}`,
      precision: 100,
      source: "@ETH_FundingPool",
      destination: johnEthBalance.id,
      description: "Initial ETH funding",
      allow_overdraft: true
    });

    // Fund Emily's MATIC balance
    await Transactions.create({
      amount: 10,
      currency: "MATIC",
      reference: `ref_${uuidv4()}`,
      precision: 100,
      source: "@MATIC_FundingPool",
      destination: emilyMaticBalance.id,
      description: "Initial MATIC funding",
      allow_overdraft: true
    });
    ```

## Phase 1: Order Creation

When John or Emily creates an order, we need to:

1. Confirm that they have sufficient funds to successfully place the order.
    ```javascript
    async function checkBalance(balanceId: string, amount: number) {
      const { Balances } = blnk;
      const balance = await Balances.retrieve(balanceId);
      const availableBalance = balance.balance - balance.inflight_debit_balance;
      
      if (amount > availableBalance) {
        return { success: false, message: 'insufficient funds' };
      }
      return { success: true, availableBalance };
    }
    ```
2. Initialize it via [inflight](/transactions/inflight) on your Ledger and reserve the funds in escrow until a match is found.
    ```javascript
    async function createInflightTransaction(balanceId: string, amount: number, currency: string, receiveCurrency: string) {
      const orderReference = `order_${uuidv4()}`;
      const { Transactions } = blnk;
      
      const inflightTx = await Transactions.inflight.create({
        amount: amount,
        currency: `${currency}`,
        precision: 100,
        source: balanceId,
        destination: `@${currency}_Escrow`,
        description: `Exchange order: ${currency} to ${receiveCurrency}`,
        reference: orderReference
      });
      
      return { inflightTx, orderReference };
    }
    ```
3. Record in our order book.
    ```javascript
    async function recordOrder(orderReference: string, sendCurrency: string, receiveCurrency: string, amount: number) {
      const orderBook = {
        reference: orderReference,
        send_currency: sendCurrency,
        receive_currency: receiveCurrency,
        amount: amount,
        status: 'pending_match',
        created_at: new Date().toISOString()
      };
      
      // Store in your order book system
      // This is a placeholder - implement your storage logic here
      return orderBook;
    }
    ```
4. Bringing it all together.
    ```javascript
    async function createExchangeOrder(
      sourceBalanceId: string,
      amount: number,
      sendCurrency: string,
      receiveCurrency: string
    ) {
      // Step 1: Check balance
      const balanceCheck = await checkBalance(sourceBalanceId, amount);
      if (!balanceCheck.success) {
        return balanceCheck;
      }

      // Step 2: Create inflight transaction
      const { inflightTx, orderReference } = await createInflightTransaction(
        sourceBalanceId,
        amount,
        sendCurrency,
        receiveCurrency
      );

      // Step 3: Record in order book
      const order = await recordOrder(orderReference, sendCurrency, receiveCurrency, amount);

      return {
        success: true,
        orderReference,
        transaction: inflightTx,
        order
      };
    }

    // Create order for John
    const johnOrder = await createExchangeOrder(
      johnEthBalance.id,  // John's ETH balance ID
      1,               // 1 ETH (with precision 100)
      'ETH',            // Sending ETH
      'MATIC'           // Receiving MATIC
    );

    // Create order for Emily
    const emilyOrder = await createExchangeOrder(
      emilyMaticBalance.id,  // Emily's MATIC balance ID
      10,               // 10 MATIC
      'MATIC',            // Sending MATIC
      'ETH'           // Receiving ETH
    );
    ```

## Phase 2: Order Matching

When two orders are matched (e.g. John and Emily), we want to link them together with a common matching ID. This helps us track which orders in our Ledger were matched with each other.

```javascript
async function linkMatchedOrders(transaction1Id: string, transaction2Id: string) {
    // Generate a unique matching ID with 'match_' prefix
    const matchingId = `match_${uuidv4()}`;

    // Update the first order's inflight transaction metadata
    await Transactions.update(transaction1Id, {
        meta_data: {
            matching_id: matchingId,
            matched_with_tx: transaction2Id
        }
    });

    // Update the second order's inflight transaction metadata
    await Transactions.update(transaction2Id, {
        meta_data: {
            matching_id: matchingId,
            matched_with_tx: transaction1Id
        }
    });

    return matchingId;
}

// Example usage when John and Emily's orders are matched:
const matchingId = await linkMatchedOrders(
    johnOrder.transaction.transaction_id,    // John's inflight transaction ID
    emilyOrder.transaction.transaction_id    // Emily's inflight transaction ID
);
```

## Phase 3: Settling the Matched Orders

Finally, we need to execute the exchange of assets between the matched orders — John & Emily. Here's how we do it:

1. We need to commit these transactions to move the funds to escrow.
2. Then we create new transactions to move funds from escrow to the respective recipient balances (John's MATIC balance and Emily's ETH balance).

```javascript
async function settleMatchedOrders(
    johnTxId: string,    // John's ETH inflight transaction ID
    emilyTxId: string    // Emily's MATIC inflight transaction ID
) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Commit both inflight transactions
        await Transactions.inflight.commit(johnTxId);
        await Transactions.inflight.commit(emilyTxId);

        // Step 2: Retrieve transaction metadata to get the matching ID
        const johnTx = await Transactions.retrieve(johnTxId);
        const matchingId = johnTx.meta_data?.matching_id || `match_${uuidv4()}`; // Fallback if missing

        const settlementReference = `settlement_${uuidv4()}`;

        // Step 3: Move ETH from escrow to Emily
        const ethTransfer = await Transactions.create({
            amount: johnTx.amount, // 1 ETH 
            currency: 'ETH',
            precision: 100,
            source: '@ETH_Escrow',
            destination: emilyEthBalance.id,
            reference: `${settlementReference}_eth`,
            meta_data: {
                matching_id: matchingId,
                settlement_type: 'exchange'
            }
        });

        // Step 4: Move MATIC from escrow to John
        const maticTransfer = await Transactions.create({
            amount: emilyTx.amount, // 10 MATIC 
            currency: 'MATIC',
            precision: 100,
            source: '@MATIC_Escrow',
            destination: johnMaticBalance.id,
            reference: `${settlementReference}_matic`,
            meta_data: {
                matching_id: matchingId,
                settlement_type: 'exchange'
            }
        });

        return { success: true, matchingId, ethTransfer, maticTransfer };
    } catch (error) {
        return { success: false, error: error.message };
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Balance Validation:** Always verify available balances before creating orders. Remember to consider both actual balances and inflight amounts to prevent over-commitment of funds.

2. **Transaction References:** Always use meaningful reference prefixes ('order_', 'match_', 'settlement_') combined with UUIDs. This makes it easier to track and audit transactions throughout their lifecycle.

3. **Metadata Management:** Keep your metadata consistent across related transactions. The matching ID should flow through all transactions involved in an exchange, creating a clear chain of linked operations.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling at each step. If any part of the process fails, you need to be able to identify where the failure occurred and handle it appropriately.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limits for order creation to prevent system overload and potential abuse. See [advanced configuration](/advanced/configuration).

2. **Currency Precision:** Different cryptocurrencies might require different precision settings. Ensure to use consistent precision value per currency in your Ledger.

3. **Escrow Management:** Regularly audit escrow accounts to ensure they zero out correctly after settlements. Any remaining balance could indicate failed or incomplete settlements.
